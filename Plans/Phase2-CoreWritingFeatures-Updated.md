## Implementation Progress

### AI Provider System

The AI provider system has been implemented with a trait-based approach that defines a common interface for all AI providers:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait AIProvider: Send + Sync {
    async fn generate_text(&self, prompt: &str, context: &AIContext) -> anyhow::Result<String>;
    async fn generate_text_stream(&self, prompt: &str, context: &AIContext) -> anyhow::Result<TextStream>;
    async fn rewrite_text(&self, text: &str, style: &RewriteStyle) -> anyhow::Result<String>;
    // Additional methods for other writing features...
}
```

Basic implementations for OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini providers have been created, but they need to be completed with full streaming support and proper error handling.

### Write Processor

The WriteProcessor has been implemented with support for three writing modes:

```rust
pub struct WriteProcessor {
    ai_provider: Arc<dyn AIProvider>,
    context_builder: ContextBuilder,
}

impl WriteProcessor {
    pub async fn auto_write(&self, document_id: i32, cursor_position: usize, settings: &WriteSettings, db_pool: &DbPool) -> Result<WriteResult> {
        // Implementation for auto-continuing text
    }
    
    pub async fn guided_write(&self, document_id: i32, user_prompt: &str, settings: &WriteSettings, db_pool: &DbPool) -> Result<WriteResult> {
        // Implementation for following user's specific instructions
    }
    
    pub async fn tone_shift_write(&self, document_id: i32, cursor_position: usize, tone: &str, settings: &WriteSettings, db_pool: &DbPool) -> Result<WriteResult> {
        // Implementation for writing with a specific tone
    }
}
```

The WriteProcessor needs to be connected to the frontend and enhanced with streaming support.

### Card System

The Card System UI has been implemented with support for displaying AI responses in a stacked, filterable interface:

```typescript
export const CardSystem: React.FC<CardSystemProps> = ({
  projectId,
  documentId,
  onCardAction,
}) => {
  // Implementation for displaying and managing AI response cards
}
```

However, it's currently using mock data and needs to be connected to the backend for persistent storage and retrieval of AI responses.
