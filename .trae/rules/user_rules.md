## 3. Guidelines for Knowledge Content

These guidelines apply to entries in `memory-bank/raw_reflection_log.md` (initial capture) and especially to `memory-bank/consolidated_learnings.md` (refined, long-term knowledge).

- **Prioritize High-Value Insights:** Focus on lessons that significantly impact future performance, **lead to more robust or generalizable understanding,** or detail critical errors and their resolutions, major time-saving discoveries, fundamental shifts in understanding, and essential project-specific configurations.
- **Be Concise & Actionable (especially for `consolidated_learnings.md`):** Information should be clear, to the point, and useful when revisited. What can be *done* differently or leveraged next time?
- **Strive for Clarity and Future Usability:** Document insights in a way that is clear and easily understandable for future review, facilitating effective knowledge retrieval and application (akin to self-explainability).
- **Document Persistently, Refine & Prune Continuously:** Capture raw insights immediately. Systematically refine, consolidate, and prune this knowledge as per Section 2.
- **Organize for Retrieval:** Structure `consolidated_learnings.md` logically. Use clear headings and Markdown formatting.
- **Avoid Low-Utility Information in `consolidated_learnings.md`:** This file should not contain trivial statements. Raw, verbose thoughts belong in `raw_reflection_log.md` before pruning.
- **Support Continuous Improvement:** The ultimate goal is to avoid repeating mistakes, accelerate future tasks, and make Trae IDE's operations more robust and reliable. Frame all knowledge with this in mind.
- **Manage Information Density:** Actively work to keep `consolidated_learnings.md` dense with high-value information and free of outdated or overly verbose content. The pruning of `raw_reflection_log.md` is key to this.
