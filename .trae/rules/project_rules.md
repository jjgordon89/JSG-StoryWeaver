   * Verify all required environment variables are configured
   * Ensure both frontend (`npm install`) and backend (`cargo check`) dependencies are satisfied
   * Validate database schema is up-to-date with latest migrations

2. **Architecture Consistency Check**:
   * Review existing patterns in `consolidated_learnings.md` for similar implementations
   * Ensure new components follow established directory structure (`src/ui/components/common/` for reusable)
   * Verify TypeScript interfaces align with corresponding Rust structs

3. **Build System Validation**:
   * Test frontend build: `npm run build`
   * Test backend compilation: `cargo check`
   * Verify no TypeScript errors or Rust warnings

### Development Workflow Standards

**Component Development Protocol:**

1. **TypeScript-First Approach**:
   * Define TypeScript interfaces before implementing React components
   * Ensure interfaces match corresponding Rust struct definitions
   * Use proper type exports from centralized type definition files

2. **State Management Consistency**:
   * Use Zustand for all state management needs
   * Avoid mixing state management solutions (no Redux, Context API for global state)
   * Implement proper state persistence where required

3. **Component Organization**:
   * Place reusable components in `src/ui/components/common/`
   * Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
   * Implement proper component exports through index files

**Backend Development Protocol:**

1. **Tauri Command Standards**:
   * Implement comprehensive error handling for all commands
   * Use proper Rust error types that map to frontend error handling
   * Ensure all commands return consistent response structures

2. **Database Integration**:
   * Validate all database operations with proper error handling
   * Ensure database schema changes include corresponding migrations
   * Test database operations with both success and failure scenarios

3. **Type Safety Enforcement**:
   * Maintain alignment between Rust structs and TypeScript interfaces
   * Use proper serialization/deserialization patterns
   * Implement comprehensive type validation

### Quality Assurance Standards

**Mandatory Validation Steps:**

1. **Build Validation**:
   * Frontend: `npm run build` must complete without errors
   * Backend: `cargo check` must complete without warnings
   * Integration: Test cross-layer communication

2. **Type Safety Validation**:
   * No TypeScript `any` types without explicit justification
   * All Rust structs properly implement required traits
   * Cross-layer type consistency verified

3. **Performance Validation**:
   * Frontend bundle size within acceptable limits
   * Backend response times meet performance requirements
   * Database queries optimized and indexed appropriately

### Error Prevention & Recovery

**Common Error Prevention Strategies:**

1. **Dependency Management**:
   * Always verify imported libraries are installed before using
   * Maintain consistent package versions across development environments
   * Use exact version pinning for critical dependencies

2. **Framework Consistency**:
   * Never mix React/Vue/Svelte components in the same application
   * Maintain consistent coding standards across all layers
   * Use established patterns from `consolidated_learnings.md`

3. **Documentation Synchronization**:
   * Update all related documentation when implementing features ahead of schedule
   * Maintain alignment between code comments and implementation
   * Keep project plans synchronized with actual implementation status

**Recovery Procedures:**

1. **Build Failure Recovery**:
   * Systematically analyze errors across all layers (React TypeScript, Rust, Database)
   * Apply known resolution patterns from `consolidated_learnings.md`
   * Validate fixes with comprehensive build testing

2. **Type Safety Recovery**:
   * Identify and resolve type mismatches between layers
   * Update corresponding interfaces and structs simultaneously
