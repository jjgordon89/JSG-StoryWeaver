PROJECT RULES
Development Phase Awareness
Current implementation should align with the 6-phase development plan (24 weeks total).

Reference the specific phase requirements when implementing features.

Follow the dependency chain: Foundation → Writing Features → Story Bible → Advanced AI → Collaboration → Polish.

Implement features incrementally according to the established success criteria.

Technology Stack Compliance
Backend: Use Rust 1.70+ with Tauri 2.0 framework and required plugins.

Database: SQLite 3.40+ for structured data, LanceDB 0.4+ for vector operations.

AI: Support OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI-compatible providers.
