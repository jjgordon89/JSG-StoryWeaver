TaskRef: "Enhanced user_rules.md with consolidated learnings integration - Version 6.0"

Learnings:

- Successfully integrated proven development patterns from consolidated_learnings.md into user_rules.md
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting section with database operations, React architecture, and Rust/Tauri integration patterns
- Enhanced productivity boosters with specific automation suggestions including third-party library integration and state management optimization
- Improved workflow analysis with cascading error resolution, recursive component rendering, and transaction-based operations
- Added detailed changelog to track version improvements and maintain protocol evolution history
- Incorporated StoryWeaver-specific insights including trait-based AI provider architecture and progressive disclosure patterns

Difficulties:

- Had to remove duplicate content that was accidentally added during enhancement process
- Required careful organization to maintain readability while adding substantial new content
- Needed to balance comprehensive coverage with concise, actionable guidance

Successes:

- Created a significantly more actionable and specific user_rules.md file (version 6.0)
- Successfully incorporated real-world development patterns from consolidated learnings
- Improved the protocol's practical value for StoryWeaver development with proven patterns
- Enhanced troubleshooting capabilities with systematic approaches
- Added performance optimization strategies for large datasets and complex UI components

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Pattern: Integrating consolidated learnings into protocol documents enhances their practical value significantly
- Process: Version control with detailed changelogs improves protocol evolution tracking and user understanding
- Organization: Structured sections with specific, proven patterns improve usability and adoption
- Integration: Combining theoretical protocols with real-world patterns creates more effective development guidance

TaskRef: "E2E Test Infrastructure Stabilization - Selector Mismatch Resolution"

Learnings:

- Identified critical selector mismatch in e2e tests: tests were looking for `h1:has-text("StoryWeaver")` but actual UI displays `h1:has-text("Projects")`
- Fixed selector mismatches across 5 test files: backup-recovery.spec.ts, document-linking.spec.ts, folder-hierarchy.spec.ts, project-preview.spec.ts, and version-history.spec.ts
- Browser-specific behavior: Chromium tests were timing out (30+ seconds) while Firefox and WebKit tests passed quickly (<15ms)
- Systematic approach to test fixing: used regex search to find all instances, then updated each file methodically
- Playwright e2e tests now pass reliably across all browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

Difficulties:

- Initial confusion about why only Chromium tests were failing while other browsers passed
- Required careful verification that UI actually displays "Projects" not "StoryWeaver" in the h1 element
- Had to update multiple test files with the same pattern

Successes:

- Achieved 100% e2e test pass rate across all browsers
- Established stable testing foundation for future development
- Documented testing patterns in systemPatterns.md for future reference
- Updated all memory bank files to reflect the completion of this critical infrastructure work

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Pattern: Always verify UI element text matches test selectors before writing tests
- Process: Use regex search to find all instances of problematic selectors for systematic fixes
- Testing: Cross-browser validation is essential; browser-specific timeouts can indicate selector issues
- Documentation: Update memory bank files immediately after completing infrastructure improvements

TaskRef: "Resolved duplicate database client extensions warning"

Learnings:

- Identified multiple unnecessary database client extensions installed: supabase.postgrestools, surrealdb.surrealql, surrealismui.surrealism-ui, and cweijan.vscode-postgresql-client2
- StoryWeaver project only uses SQLite database through SQLx, making PostgreSQL and SurrealDB extensions unnecessary
- VS Code extension conflicts can cause performance issues and confusing warnings
- Systematic approach to extension management: identify project requirements, audit installed extensions, remove unnecessary ones

Difficulties:

- Initial search for database configurations in codebase didn't immediately reveal the extension conflict source
- Required systematic investigation through VS Code extension list to identify all conflicting extensions
- Multiple extensions needed individual uninstallation commands

Successes:

- Successfully identified and removed all unnecessary database client extensions
- Confirmed StoryWeaver project uses only SQLite, making mtxr.sqltools the appropriate remaining extension
- Resolved the "Duplicate Database Client extensions detected!" warning
- Improved VS Code performance by removing unused extensions
- Established clear extension management pattern for future reference

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Pattern: Extension audit and cleanup should be part of project setup and maintenance
- Pattern: Match installed extensions to actual project technology stack requirements
- StoryWeaver: Project uses SQLite exclusively, only SQLTools extension needed for database management
- General: VS Code extension conflicts can cause performance and usability issues
