# Active Context: StoryWeaver

## Current Work Focus
We've made significant progress on Phase 1 of the StoryWeaver project, establishing the foundation for the application. Phase 1 is approximately 85% complete, with several critical backend integrations and foundational systems still needing to be completed before we can officially move on to Phase 2.

## Recent Events (Last 10)
- **2025-08-06:** Updated Phase 1 documentation to reflect accurate completion status (~85% complete).
- **2025-08-06:** Implemented Card System UI with stacking, filtering, and interaction features.
- **2025-08-06:** Added theme support with light/dark modes and accessibility features.
- **2025-08-06:** Configured Windows MSI build with installer customization.
- **2025-08-06:** Implemented AI Provider abstraction layer with OpenAI and Claude providers.
- **2025-08-06:** Implemented DocumentLinking component for chapter continuity.
- **2025-08-06:** Created SeriesManager component for multi-project workflows.
- **2025-08-06:** Implemented FolderHierarchy component with drag-and-drop support.
- **2025-08-06:** Enhanced DocumentEditor with improved auto-save and word count tracking.
- **2025-08-06:** Updated ProjectList to display documents and handle document selection.
- **2025-08-06:** Updated ProjectCard to support selection state.
- **2025-08-06:** Updated ProjectView to accept document selection callbacks.
- **2025-08-06:** Enhanced MainLayout to integrate document editor and navigation.
- **2025-08-05:** Initialized Memory Bank by creating the `memory-bank/` directory and core documentation files.

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Critical Backend Integration:**
   - Connect folder hierarchy drag-and-drop to backend
   - Implement backend for series management
   - Connect document linking system to backend
   - Ensure all UI components are properly integrated with data layer

2. **Implement Core System Foundations:**
   - Create database backup and recovery system
   - Add project preview functionality
   - Implement deleted projects recovery system (trash)
   - Build document version history
   - Add focus mode for distraction-free writing

3. **Address Additional Foundation Components:**
   - Create managed task queue for long-running AI operations
   - Implement basic performance metrics collection
   - Set up memory usage monitoring
   - Add database query performance tracking

Once these critical items are completed, we can move on to Phase 2: Core Writing Features.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- We've implemented a modular AI Provider system with a trait-based abstraction layer, allowing easy integration of different AI services.
- The AI Provider system includes rate limiting and token counting to manage API usage efficiently.
- Both OpenAI and Claude providers have been implemented, demonstrating the modularity of the system.
- We're using a component-based architecture with React and TypeScript for the frontend.
- Monaco Editor is being used for the document editor with custom hooks for features.
- We're using Zustand for state management and React Query for server state.
- The folder hierarchy uses a recursive component approach for displaying nested folders, but backend integration is still needed.
- Series support UI is implemented but needs backend integration for data persistence.
- Document linking UI is implemented but needs backend integration for actual functionality.
- The Card System UI provides a flexible way to display AI responses with filtering, sorting, and stacking capabilities.
- Theme support includes light/dark modes and accessibility features like reduced motion, high contrast, and font size adjustments.
- Windows MSI build configuration is set up for easy distribution with customizable installer options.
- We've decided to defer some non-critical features to Phase 2, including secure API key storage, file path navigation with breadcrumbs, and some error handling features.
- The current priority is to complete the backend integration for existing UI components before moving on to Phase 2.
