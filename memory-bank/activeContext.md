# Active Context: StoryWeaver

## Current Work Focus
We've made significant progress on Phase 1 of the StoryWeaver project, establishing the foundation for the application. Phase 1 is approximately 99% complete, with only three remaining tasks that need to be completed before we can officially move on to Phase 2: implementing project preview functionality, creating UI components for the backend administrative systems (backup, trash, version history), and performing end-to-end testing of the backend-UI integration.

While completing the final Phase 1 tasks, we've also begun initial work on Phase 2 (Core Writing Features). We've implemented the foundation of the AI provider system with support for OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini, created a basic WriteProcessor with multiple writing modes, and developed the frontend Card System UI for displaying AI responses. An updated Phase 2 plan has been created to reflect the current progress and remaining tasks.

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Final Phase 1 Integration Tasks:**
   - Implement project preview functionality
   - Create UI components for backup, trash, and version history management
   - Perform end-to-end testing of backend-UI integration

2. **Continue Phase 2 Implementation:**
   - Complete AI Provider Integration:
     - âœ“ Implement proper streaming support for OpenAI and Claude providers
     - Connect AI providers to the frontend
   - Implement Core Writing Tools:
     - Complete the Write feature with frontend integration
     - Implement Rewrite, Expand, and Describe features
     - Add Brainstorm and Visualize tools
   - Build Intelligent Selection Menu
   - Develop Saliency Engine
   - Implement Quick Tools
   - Connect Card System to Backend
   - Add Collaboration Features

3. **Stabilization and Security:**
   - Standardize backend error handling (replace unwrap/expect, adopt StoryWeaverError consistently)
   - Expand unit and integration tests for command validation paths and rate limiting behavior
   - Evaluate rate limit coverage expansion and sensible defaults

4. **Update Documentation:**
   - Keep the Phase 2 plan updated as implementation progresses
   - Document new AI features and their usage
   - Reflect completed input validation coverage in security documentation and onboarding notes

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- We've implemented a modular AI Provider system with a trait-based abstraction layer, allowing easy integration of different AI services.
- The AI Provider system includes rate limiting and token counting to manage API usage efficiently.
- Both OpenAI and Claude providers have been implemented, with Gemini support added as well.
- All AI providers now have proper streaming support for all writing features, enabling real-time text generation with typewriter effects.
- The AI Provider system defines a comprehensive interface for various writing features including Write, Rewrite, Expand, Describe, Brainstorm, and more.
- We've implemented a basic WriteProcessor with support for auto_write, guided_write, and tone_shift_write modes.
- We're using a component-based architecture with React and TypeScript for the frontend.
- Monaco Editor is being used for the document editor with custom hooks for features.
- We're using Zustand for state management and React Query for server state.
- The folder hierarchy uses a recursive component approach for displaying nested folders with backend integration for drag-and-drop operations.
- Series support UI is now connected to backend commands for data persistence.
- Document linking UI is now connected to backend commands for actual functionality.
- The Card System UI provides a flexible way to display AI responses with filtering, sorting, and stacking capabilities.
- Theme support includes light/dark modes and accessibility features like reduced motion, high contrast, and font size adjustments.
- Windows MSI build configuration is set up for easy distribution with customizable installer options.
- We've implemented a comprehensive database backup and recovery system with automatic backups, backup management, and restore capabilities.
- We've implemented a trash system for deleted projects and documents with restore functionality.
- We've implemented a document version history system with the ability to create versions, view history, and restore to previous versions.
- We've implemented a focus mode for distraction-free writing with customizable settings, keyboard shortcuts, and visual enhancements.
- We've implemented a state persistence layer for application settings that synchronizes between frontend and backend, providing both local storage (via Zustand persist) and database persistence.
- We've implemented a state synchronization system for real-time updates across components, using Tauri events for communication between frontend and backend, and custom React hooks and Zustand middleware for state management.
- The state synchronization system supports various types of events including document updates, settings changes, and card interactions, ensuring consistent state across the application.
- The settings system supports various types of settings including theme preferences, editor settings, accessibility options, and application-specific settings.
- We've implemented a comprehensive performance monitoring system with metrics collection, memory usage tracking, database query performance monitoring, and bottleneck detection.
- The performance monitoring system includes a dashboard for visualizing metrics, a settings panel for configuration, and a React hook for component-level monitoring.
- Performance metrics are stored in the database with automatic cleanup of old data, and the system supports real-time monitoring with configurable thresholds.
- We've decided to defer some non-critical features to Phase 2, including secure API key storage, file path navigation with breadcrumbs, and some error handling features.
- The current priority is to test the backend integration for UI components, implement UI components for the newly added backend systems, and complete the remaining core system foundations before moving on to Phase 2.
