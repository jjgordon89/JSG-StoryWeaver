## Active Decisions & Considerations
- We've implemented a modular AI Provider system with a trait-based abstraction layer, allowing easy integration of different AI services.
- The AI Provider system includes rate limiting and token counting to manage API usage efficiently.
- Both OpenAI and Claude providers have been implemented, demonstrating the modularity of the system.
- We're using a component-based architecture with React and TypeScript for the frontend.
- Monaco Editor is being used for the document editor with custom hooks for features.
- We're using Zustand for state management and React Query for server state.
- The folder hierarchy uses a recursive component approach for displaying nested folders.
- Series support allows projects to share story bible data for consistent worldbuilding.
- Document linking enables continuity between chapters with bidirectional navigation.
