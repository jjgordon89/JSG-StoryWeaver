# Progress: StoryWeaver

## Current Status
The project has **completed approximately 99% of Phase 1: Foundation**. We've made significant progress on the frontend UI components, AI provider abstraction, card system UI, theme support, and Windows MSI build configuration. We've also implemented backend commands for folder hierarchy management, series management, document linking system, database backup and recovery, trash management, and document version history. There are only three remaining items that need to be completed before we can officially move on to Phase 2.

## What Works
### Backend Foundation
- Tauri 2.0 project is set up and runs
- SQLite database is created with the correct schema via migrations
- Comprehensive data models (Projects, Documents, Characters, Locations, Story Bible)
- Backend command structure for all core entities
- Error handling system with StoryWeaverError enum
- Database connection pooling and async operations
- AI response card data structure
- AI Provider abstraction layer with OpenAI and Claude implementations
- Rate limiting and token counting for AI API usage
- Windows MSI build configuration with installer customization
- Backend commands for folder hierarchy management
- Backend commands for series management
- Backend commands for document linking system
- Backend commands for settings management and persistence
- Performance monitoring system with metrics collection, memory tracking, and bottleneck detection

### Frontend & Integration
- Three-column responsive UI layout
- Project management interface with project cards
- Document editor with Monaco Editor integration
- Auto-save functionality with debouncing and status indicators
- Word count tracking for documents
- Folder hierarchy with drag-and-drop support (UI only)
- Series support for multi-project workflows (UI only)
- Document linking system for chapter continuity (UI only)
- Card system UI with stacking, filtering, and interaction features
- Theme support with light/dark modes
- Accessibility features including reduced motion, high contrast, and font size adjustments
- Focus mode for distraction-free writing with customizable settings
- Settings UI with theme, editor, accessibility, and application settings
- State persistence layer with local storage and backend synchronization
- Performance dashboard with real-time metrics visualization
- Performance monitoring hook for component-level tracking

## What's Left to Complete in Phase 1
1. **Final Integration Tasks** (Critical)
   - ⏳ Implement project preview functionality
   - ⏳ Create UI components for backup, trash, and version history management
   - ⏳ Perform end-to-end testing of backend-UI integration

2. **Backend Integration** (Completed)
   - ✅ Implement backend commands for folder hierarchy management
   - ✅ Implement backend commands for series management
   - ✅ Implement backend commands for document linking system
   - ✅ Connect UI components to the backend commands
   - ✅ Ensure all UI components are properly integrated with data layer

3. **Core System Foundations** (Completed)
   - ✅ Create database backup and recovery system
   - ✅ Add deleted projects recovery system (trash)
   - ✅ Build document version history
   - ✅ Implement focus mode for distraction-free writing
   - ✅ Create state persistence layer for application settings
   - ✅ Build state synchronization system for real-time updates

4. **Additional Foundation Components** (Completed)
   - ✅ Create managed task queue for long-running AI operations
   - ✅ Implement basic performance metrics collection
   - ✅ Set up memory usage monitoring
   - ✅ Add database query performance tracking
   - ✅ Create performance dashboard with real-time metrics visualization

## Deferred to Phase 2
The following items have been intentionally deferred to Phase 2:
- Secure API key storage using OS keychain
- File path navigation with breadcrumbs
- User-friendly error notifications
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Error reporting and diagnostics

## Next Steps Before Moving to Phase 2
1. **Complete Final Integration Tasks**
   - Implement project preview functionality
   - Create UI components for backup, trash, and version history management
   - Perform end-to-end testing of backend-UI integration

2. **Prepare for Phase 2**
   - Review Phase 2 plan and ensure all prerequisites are in place
   - Ensure documentation is up-to-date for all Phase 1 components
   - Create a smooth transition plan from foundation to core writing features

## Known Issues
- Need to test the integration between UI components and backend commands to ensure proper functionality
- Need to implement UI components for the newly added backend systems (backup, trash, version history)
- Need to verify that automatic backups work correctly in production environments
