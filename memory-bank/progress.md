# Progress: StoryWeaver

## Current Status
The project has **completed approximately 99% of Phase 1: Foundation**. We've made significant progress on the frontend UI components, AI provider abstraction, card system UI, theme support, and Windows MSI build configuration. We've also implemented backend commands for folder hierarchy management, series management, document linking system, database backup and recovery, trash management, and document version history. There are only three remaining items that need to be completed before we can officially move on to Phase 2.

While completing the final Phase 1 tasks, we've also **begun initial work on Phase 2: Core Writing Features**. We've implemented the foundation of the AI provider system with support for OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini, created a basic WriteProcessor with multiple writing modes, and developed the frontend Card System UI for displaying AI responses. An updated Phase 2 plan has been created to reflect the current progress and remaining tasks.

## What Works
### Backend Foundation
- Tauri 2.0 project is set up and runs
- SQLite database is created with the correct schema via migrations
- Comprehensive data models (Projects, Documents, Characters, Locations, Story Bible)
- Backend command structure for all core entities
- Error handling system with StoryWeaverError enum
- Database connection pooling and async operations
- AI response card data structure
- AI Provider abstraction layer with OpenAI and Claude implementations
- Rate limiting and token counting for AI API usage
- Windows MSI build configuration with installer customization
- Backend commands for folder hierarchy management
- Backend commands for series management
- Backend commands for document linking system
- Backend commands for settings management and persistence
- Performance monitoring system with metrics collection, memory tracking, and bottleneck detection

- Comprehensive input validation coverage for all Tauri command handlers, with size, length, sanitization, and numeric-bounds enforcement via validate_security_input, validate_content_length, and validate_request_body_size
- Comprehensive error handling standardization across backend codebase, replacing unsafe unwrap/expect patterns with proper error handling, logging, and data validation in collaboration.rs, brainstorm_session_ops.rs, and other critical files
- Complete framework consolidation: Successfully migrated all Svelte components to React, achieving unified React-only architecture
- AI card filtering system: Full implementation in AIResponseCard::get_filtered with support for project_id, document_id, feature_type, is_stacked, is_starred, date_start, date_end, provider, model_used, cost_min, cost_max, limit, and offset
- AIResponseCache time-based clearing: Complete implementation with TTL per entry, background sweeper (start_background_sweeper), manual cleanup (clear_expired_entries), and comprehensive test coverage
### Frontend & Integration
- Three-column responsive UI layout
- Project management interface with project cards
- Document editor with Monaco Editor integration
- Auto-save functionality with debouncing and status indicators
- Word count tracking for documents
- Folder hierarchy with drag-and-drop support (UI only)
- Series support for multi-project workflows (UI only)
- Document linking system for chapter continuity (UI only)
- Card system UI with stacking, filtering, and interaction features
- Theme support with light/dark modes
- Accessibility features including reduced motion, high contrast, and font size adjustments
- Focus mode for distraction-free writing with customizable settings
- Settings UI with theme, editor, accessibility, and application settings
- State persistence layer with local storage and backend synchronization
- Performance dashboard with real-time metrics visualization
- Performance monitoring hook for component-level tracking
- AdvancedAI Style Manager: update, delete, bulk delete implemented with optimistic UI and local persistence; Generate-from-style wired to generate_with_prose_mode using selected style constraints
- UI components for backup, trash, and version history management: Complete DataManagement.tsx with BackupManager, TrashManager, and VersionOverview components fully implemented and functional
- E2E test infrastructure: All Playwright tests now pass reliably across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers; fixed selector mismatches and timeout issues

## What's Left to Complete in Phase 1

   - ✅ Implement backend commands for series management
   - ✅ Implement backend commands for document linking system
   - ✅ Connect UI components to the backend commands
   - ✅ Ensure all UI components are properly integrated with data layer

3. **Core System Foundations** (Completed)
   - ✅ Create database backup and recovery system
   - ✅ Add deleted projects recovery system (trash)
   - ✅ Build document version history
   - ✅ Implement focus mode for distraction-free writing
   - ✅ Create state persistence layer for application settings
   - ✅ Build state synchronization system for real-time updates

4. **Additional Foundation Components** (Completed)
   - ✅ Create managed task queue for long-running AI operations
   - ✅ Implement basic performance metrics collection
   - ✅ Set up memory usage monitoring
   - ✅ Add database query performance tracking
   - ✅ Create performance dashboard with real-time metrics visualization

## Deferred to Phase 2
The following items have been intentionally deferred to Phase 2:
- Secure API key storage using OS keychain
- File path navigation with breadcrumbs
- User-friendly error notifications
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Error reporting and diagnostics

## Phase 2 Progress So Far
### AI Provider Framework
- ✅ Implemented AI provider abstraction layer with trait-based interface
- ✅ Created basic integrations for OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini providers
- ⏳ Complete streaming implementation for all providers
- ⏳ Implement DALL-E 3 / Google Imagen integration for the Visualize feature
- ⏳ Connect AI providers to the frontend with proper error handling

### Core Systems
- ⏳ Saliency Engine (Foundation): Develop initial context relevance algorithms and the context optimizer
- ✅ Token Management: Implement basic token counting and credit calculation
- ⏳ Enhance token management with optimization strategies and a token budget calculator
- ⏳ Credit Management: Build the cost estimation engine, usage tracker, and low-balance warning system
- ⏳ Error Handling: Create the error recovery manager with strategies for network timeouts, API rate limits, and content filtering

### Writing Tools
- ✅ Implement basic Write feature with multiple modes (Auto, Guided, Tone Shift)
- ⏳ Complete the Write feature with frontend integration and streaming support
- ⏳ Build Rewrite tool with multiple styles (Rephrase, Shorter, More Descriptive, etc.)
- ⏳ Create Expand and Describe features with sensory detail toggles
- ⏳ Add configurable creativity levels (1-10) and Key Details for project-level context

### Canvas/Visual Planning System
- ✅ Canvas System Completion (Task C4): Complete React frontend implementation with drag-and-drop functionality, outline template system, export functionality, keyboard shortcuts, collaboration features, and full backend integration. All 11 element types supported with zoom controls, viewport management, and real-time collaboration sessions.

### UI Components
- ✅ Card Stacking System: Implement the UI for organizing AI responses into collapsible, stackable cards
- ⏳ Connect the Card System to the backend for persistent storage and retrieval of AI responses

- ⏳ Create purple text highlighting for AI-generated content

## Next Steps
1.  **Execute the 1-2 Week Implementation Plan**:
    *   **i18n Implementation**: Adopt `react-i18next` and externalize strings.
    *   **Playwright E2E Stabilization**: Stabilize test suite and add smoke tests.
    *   **AI Provider Parity**: Unify streaming and implement guided suggestions.

## Known Issues
- Need to test the integration between UI components and backend commands to ensure proper functionality
- Need to implement UI components for the newly added backend systems (backup, trash, version history)
- Need to verify that automatic backups work correctly in production environments
