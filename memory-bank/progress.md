# Progress: StoryWeaver

## Current Status
The project is currently at **~70% completion** of **Phase 1: Foundation**. We've made significant progress on both the backend foundation and frontend UI components. The core document editing functionality, project organization, and document linking features are now implemented.

## What Works
### Backend Foundation
- Tauri 2.0 project is set up and runs
- SQLite database is created with the correct schema via migrations
- Comprehensive data models (Projects, Documents, Characters, Locations, Story Bible)
- Backend command structure for all core entities
- Error handling system with StoryWeaverError enum
- Database connection pooling and async operations
- AI response card data structure
- AI Provider abstraction layer with OpenAI and Claude implementations
- Rate limiting and token counting for AI API usage

### Frontend & Integration
- Three-column responsive UI layout
- Project management interface with project cards
- Document editor with Monaco Editor integration
- Auto-save functionality with debouncing and status indicators
- Word count tracking for documents
- Folder hierarchy with drag-and-drop support
- Series support for multi-project workflows
- Document linking system for chapter continuity

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Priorities)
1. ~~**AI Provider Abstraction Layer**~~ ✅ **Completed**
   - ~~Create interface for different AI providers~~ ✅
   - ~~Implement basic OpenAI integration~~ ✅
   - ~~Implement Claude integration~~ ✅
   - ~~Set up rate limiting and request queuing~~ ✅
   - Add secure API key storage

2. **Card System UI**
   - Create card components for AI responses
   - Implement card stacking and organization
   - Add interaction handlers (expand/collapse)
   - Build card history and persistence

3. **Theme Support & Accessibility**
   - Implement dark/light theme toggle
   - Add keyboard navigation
   - Ensure screen reader compatibility
   - Add focus indicators and proper ARIA attributes

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Configure Windows MSI installer
   - Set up automated build process
   - Create installation wizard

## Known Issues
- Document editor placeholder data needs to be connected to actual backend
- Folder hierarchy drag-and-drop needs backend implementation
- Series management needs to be connected to the backend
- Document linking needs to be connected to the backend
