# Progress: StoryWeaver

## Current Status
The project has **completed approximately 85% of Phase 1: Foundation**. While we've made significant progress on the frontend UI components, AI provider abstraction, card system UI, theme support, and Windows MSI build configuration, there are several critical backend integrations and foundational systems that need to be completed before we can officially move on to Phase 2.

## What Works
### Backend Foundation
- Tauri 2.0 project is set up and runs
- SQLite database is created with the correct schema via migrations
- Comprehensive data models (Projects, Documents, Characters, Locations, Story Bible)
- Backend command structure for all core entities
- Error handling system with StoryWeaverError enum
- Database connection pooling and async operations
- AI response card data structure
- AI Provider abstraction layer with OpenAI and Claude implementations
- Rate limiting and token counting for AI API usage
- Windows MSI build configuration with installer customization

### Frontend & Integration
- Three-column responsive UI layout
- Project management interface with project cards
- Document editor with Monaco Editor integration
- Auto-save functionality with debouncing and status indicators
- Word count tracking for documents
- Folder hierarchy with drag-and-drop support (UI only)
- Series support for multi-project workflows (UI only)
- Document linking system for chapter continuity (UI only)
- Card system UI with stacking, filtering, and interaction features
- Theme support with light/dark modes
- Accessibility features including reduced motion, high contrast, and font size adjustments

## What's Left to Complete in Phase 1
1. **Backend Integration** (Critical)
   - Connect folder hierarchy drag-and-drop to backend
   - Implement backend for series management
   - Connect document linking system to backend
   - Ensure all UI components are properly integrated with data layer

2. **Core System Foundations** (Important)
   - Create database backup and recovery system
   - Implement project preview functionality
   - Add deleted projects recovery system (trash)
   - Build document version history
   - Implement focus mode for distraction-free writing
   - Create state persistence layer for application settings
   - Build state synchronization system for real-time updates

3. **Additional Foundation Components** (Should Have)
   - Create managed task queue for long-running AI operations
   - Implement basic performance metrics collection
   - Set up memory usage monitoring
   - Add database query performance tracking

## Deferred to Phase 2
The following items have been intentionally deferred to Phase 2:
- Secure API key storage using OS keychain
- File path navigation with breadcrumbs
- User-friendly error notifications
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- Error reporting and diagnostics

## Next Steps Before Moving to Phase 2
1. **Complete Critical Backend Integration**
   - Focus on connecting the UI components to the backend
   - Ensure data persistence for all user actions
   - Test end-to-end workflows for core functionality

2. **Implement Core System Foundations**
   - Prioritize database backup and recovery
   - Add document version history
   - Create project preview and trash functionality

3. **Evaluate Remaining Items**
   - Assess which remaining foundation components are truly necessary before Phase 2
   - Create a plan to address these items in priority order

## Known Issues
- Document editor currently uses placeholder data instead of actual backend data
- Folder hierarchy drag-and-drop is implemented in UI but not connected to backend
- Series management UI exists but lacks backend implementation
- Document linking UI exists but lacks backend implementation
