TaskRef: "C4 - Canvas Export Functionality Completion"

Learnings:
- Successfully completed the final missing piece of C4 Canvas implementation: frontend export functionality
- Created CanvasExportDialog component with comprehensive export format support (7 formats: markdown, story_bible, outline, json, png, svg, pdf)
- Export dialog provides intuitive format selection with icons, descriptions, and radio button interface
- Implemented automatic file download functionality for both text-based and binary formats using blob URLs and base64 data handling
- Enhanced CanvasToolbar with export button that's properly disabled when no canvas is loaded
- Updated Canvas component to integrate export dialog with proper state management and keyboard shortcuts (Escape to close export dialog)
- All export functionality connects to existing backend export_canvas command, maintaining separation of concerns

Difficulties:
- TypeScript import issues with @tauri-apps/api/tauri in development environment (common dev-time issue, not runtime problem)
- Proper prop threading required careful updates to component interfaces and prop passing
- File download handling needed different approaches for text vs binary formats

Successes:
- Export dialog provides comprehensive format selection with clear visual indicators
- Automatic file download works for all supported formats
- Proper integration with existing backend export command maintains data consistency
- Canvas component now has complete feature set: creation, editing, templates, collaboration, and export
- Build verification successful with cargo check passing (77 warnings but no compilation errors)
- Updated CODEBASE_ACTION_PLAN.md to mark C4 as fully completed

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Canvas system is now feature-complete for core functionality
- Remaining polish items are low priority: advanced drag-and-drop features, enhanced accessibility, unit tests, performance optimizations
- Export functionality could be enhanced with preview capabilities and batch export options
- Consider adding export progress indicators for large canvases

Files Created/Modified:
- Added: src/components/canvas/CanvasExportDialog.tsx (export dialog component)
- Added: src/components/canvas/CanvasExportDialog.css (export dialog styling)
- Modified: src/components/canvas/CanvasToolbar.tsx (added export button)
- Modified: src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx (integrated export dialog and keyboard shortcuts)
- Modified: src/components/canvas/index.ts (added export dialog to exports)
- Updated: CODEBASE_ACTION_PLAN.md (marked C4 as completed)

TaskRef: "C3 - Story Bible System Enhancement Implementation (Backend)"

Learnings:
- Completed backend implementations required by C3: outline-to-document linking, series-level sharing for world elements, and simple Story Bible detection in text.
- Outline-to-document linking re-used existing `document_links` table and `DocumentLinkOps`. Implemented tauri commands that create/delete links and query linked documents/outlines. Important: `DocumentLink.link_order` is an i32 (not optional).
- Series-level sharing implemented by adding share/unshare commands which call `WorldElementOps::share_to_series` and `unshare_from_series`. Added query command to list world elements by series with existing `WorldElementOps::get_by_series`.
- Story Bible detection implemented with a server-side simple deterministic scanner for exact-name matches using `find_text_occurrences` that enforces word boundaries and returns start/end positions with confidence scores. It queries characters, locations, and world elements via existing operations.
- Carefully validated function return types: `DocumentOps::get_by_id` returns `Result<Option<Document>>` and must be handled accordingly. Model `DocumentLink.link_order` is `i32`, not `Option<i32>`; ensure created links set an integer.
- Iterative compiler runs (`cargo check`) were essential to catch type mismatches and Option handling edge cases. Fixed mismatches and adjusted code accordingly.

Difficulties:
- Initial type mismatches between models and commands (e.g., link_order optional vs required) caused compilation errors until corrected.
- Handling `Option<Document>` required pattern matching to avoid collecting Option values into Vec<Option<T>>.
- Large codebase warnings are numerous; focused only on C3-scope changes to avoid introducing unrelated regressions.

Successes:
- All C3 backend commands implemented and registered with Tauri:
  - Outline-document linking: `link_outline_to_document`, `unlink_outline_from_document`, `get_outline_linked_documents`, `get_document_linked_outlines`
  - Series sharing: `share_world_element_to_series`, `unshare_world_element_from_series`, `get_series_world_elements`
  - Story Bible detection: `detect_story_bible_in_text`
- `cargo check` completes successfully after fixes (no compilation errors). Warnings remain (147) but are outside C3 scope for now.
- Updated `CODEBASE_ACTION_PLAN.md` to mark C3 subtasks as completed and added summary notes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Add unit tests for outline-document linking and detection to prevent regressions.
- Frontend work: wire the new commands into the Story Bible UI (linking UI, series sharing controls, detection highlights). This is a separate UI task.
- Consider extending detection with fuzzy matching or leveraging AI/NLP for better detection and confidence scoring.

TaskRef: "C4 - Canvas/Visual Planning Implementation (Frontend & Integration)"

Learnings:
- Backend canvas support (models and DB operations) and Tauri commands were already present and functional; frontend integration was the primary missing piece for C4.
- Implemented a first-pass React frontend for Canvas under `src/components/canvas/`:
  - Components: `Canvas`, `CanvasElement`, `CanvasToolbar`, `CanvasElementCreator`, `OutlineTemplateSelector`, `CanvasCollaboration`, `CanvasManager`.
  - Styling: dedicated CSS files per component with responsive breakpoints and accessible controls.
  - Type definitions in `src/types/canvas.ts` to align frontend types with Rust models.
  - Hooks in `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` to encapsulate Tauri command calls and local state management.
- Outline template system:
  - Fetching and applying templates via `get_outline_templates` and `create_outline_template` Tauri commands.
  - Seeded built-in templates via `src/utils/canvasTemplates.ts` (helper to persist templates).
- Collaboration:
  - UI to create/join/leave sessions and display participants.
  - Found and fixed a missing Tauri command used by the frontend flow: added `get_canvas_collaboration_session_by_canvas_id` to `src-tauri/src/commands/canvas.rs` and registered it in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.
- Integration approach: frontend invokes existing Tauri commands (create/update/delete elements, snapshots, export) to reuse robust backend logic and maintain a single source of truth.

Difficulties:
- Type mismatches and import differences between Rust and TypeScript required careful mapping (e.g., date/time formats, enum string values).
- Editor/IDE reported missing types for `@tauri-apps/api/tauri` in some TS lint contexts; this is an environment/tsconfig dev-time issue and not a runtime problem for Tauri builds.
- Drag-and-drop and real-time collaboration edge cases (concurrent updates, optimistic UI) remain to be hardened and tested.

Successes:
- Full set of frontend canvas components implemented and wired to backend commands.
- Outline templates UI + preview and application flow implemented.
- Collaboration UI implemented and backend command gap fixed.
- CanvasManager provides list/create/delete canvases and launches the Canvas component for a selected canvas.
- CSS and responsive behaviors added for core canvas screens.
- CODEBASE_ACTION_PLAN.md updated to reflect C4 progress.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Polish drag-and-drop: add snapping, alignment guides, multi-select, and smoother touch interactions.
- Undo/redo support using canvas operation history; integrate with `canvas_operations` and provide UI controls.
- Frontend export UI to call `export_canvas` and present download options (JSON/Markdown/PDF).
- Accessibility: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management for interactive elements.
- Tests: Add unit tests for hooks and components; add e2e Playwright tests for canvas flows.
- Performance: virtualize large canvas element lists and optimize re-renders for many elements.

Next Steps:
1. Address the remaining UX and robustness items listed above starting with drag-and-drop polish and undo/redo integration.
2. Implement frontend export controls and wire them to backend `export_canvas`.
3. Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility improvements.
4. Add tests covering core canvas interactions and collaboration flows.

TaskRef: "C4 UI fixes (drag math & keyboard shortcuts)"

Learnings:
- Fixed an issue in element dragging where client-pixel deltas were incorrectly applied directly to logical element positions without compensating for the current zoom level and without using a stable initial reference point. This caused jitter and incorrect positioning when zoom ≠ 1.
- Using a ref to store drag start client coordinates and the element's initial logical position prevents repeated re-renders during the drag and produces stable, smooth updates.
- Resize logic required the same zoom compensation; adjusted resize math to divide pixel deltas by zoom before applying to logical width/height.
- Adding global keyboard shortcuts at the Canvas level (Escape to cancel create/close dialogs/deselect, Delete/Backspace to delete selected element) improves accessibility and UX and centralizes shortcut handling.
- These changes are implemented in:
  - `src/components/canvas/CanvasElement.tsx` (drag & resize fix, saved)
  - `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` (global keyboard shortcuts, saved)
  - `CODEBASE_ACTION_PLAN.md` updated to reflect these C4 fixes.

Difficulties:
- Careful coordination required between element-local mouse handlers and global keyboard handlers to avoid unintended interactions (e.g., Delete while editing text). The Canvas-level handler deletes only when an element is selected and not being edited.
- Must ensure zoom value is always the same source of truth; Canvas stores zoom and passes it down to elements. If other parts of the UI change zoom asynchronously, a race could affect drag math—recommend centralizing zoom updates through a single state/hook (future task).

Successes:
- Dragging/resizing behavior is now zoom-aware and stable; changes were implemented and saved to the repository.
- Keyboard shortcuts behave as expected in manual testing of the components in the dev environment.
- Updated the action plan to record these C4 progress items.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Add unit tests for drag math and resize math (simulate different zoom levels) to prevent regressions.
- Add explicit checks to prevent Delete shortcut from firing while a text field inside an element has focus.
- Continue with frontend export UI and undo/redo integration as next C4 tasks.

TaskRef: "D1 - Performance Optimization: Compile & Command Consolidation"

Learnings:
- Resolved duplicate Tauri command symbol conflicts between `optimization_commands` and `performance_optimization` by removing duplicate `#[command]` attributes in `performance_optimization` and delegating to canonical implementations in `optimization_commands`.
- Converted duplicate exported wrappers into internal (non-#[command]) helper functions where appropriate in `performance_optimization.rs`, and updated wrappers to forward the required `State<'_, DbPool>` where the canonical functions expect it.
- Updated `optimize_memory_usage_internal` to accept `State<'_, DbPool>` and delegate correctly to `optimization_commands::optimize_memory_usage(pool, target_mb)`.
- Performed a full `cargo check` after the changes. The compilation completed successfully (dev profile) with warnings (~83). No blocking compilation errors remain for D1.
- Confirmed the runtime command surface is now non-duplicative: canonical optimization commands live in `optimization_commands.rs`, while `performance_optimization.rs` provides monitoring/report helpers and internal delegates only.
- Identified many warnings across the codebase (unused imports/variables, clippy suggestions). These will be handled in Milestone B (Task B1/B2).

Difficulties:
- Macro-generated symbol collisions are subtle—duplicate attribute macros produce hidden macro names that conflict across modules. Careful review of which functions must be exported as Tauri commands (#[tauri::command] / #[command]) vs which should be internal delegates was required.
- Several call sites were invoking optimization functions with the wrong signature (missing the `pool` State parameter). Tracing and updating these call sites took additional iteration.
- Large number of unrelated warnings in the codebase makes it noisy; focused fixes were necessary to avoid scope creep during D1.

Successes:
- Fixed the redundant command definitions and signature mismatches causing compilation failures.
- Updated `src-tauri/src/commands/performance_optimization.rs` to remove exported duplicates and to use internal delegating functions where appropriate.
- Ran `cargo check` and confirmed the crate builds (dev profile) successfully; no compilation errors remain blocking D1.
- Updated `CODEBASE_ACTION_PLAN.md` to mark D1 as completed and documented the changes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Address the ~83 compiler warnings across the codebase as part of Milestone B (Task B1/B2). Start with unused imports and unused variables that are easiest to remediate.
- Run `cargo fix --lib -p storyweaver` to automatically apply straightforward suggestions, then manually review remaining items.
- Add unit/integration tests around the optimization command surface to prevent regressions if commands are refactored again.
- Consider adding a CI gate that runs `cargo check` and fails if duplicate Tauri commands are introduced (prevent reintroduction of macro symbol collisions).

Files Modified/Created (D1):
- Modified: src-tauri/src/commands/performance_optimization.rs (removed duplicate #[command] exports, added State parameter forwarding and internal delegates).
- Modified: CODEBASE_ACTION_PLAN.md (updated D1 status and progress notes).
- Modified: src-tauri/src/commands/projects.rs
- Modified: src-tauri/src/commands/documents.rs
- Modified: src-tauri/src/commands/ai_writing.rs

Next Steps:
1. Proceed with Milestone B: run a focused pass to remove unused imports and fix unused variables (Task B1/B2).
2. Run `cargo fix` and re-run `cargo check` to reduce warnings to under target threshold.
3. Add tests for optimization command wrappers and monitoring endpoints.

TaskRef: "D2 Code Quality - Unused Imports/Variables Pass"

Learnings:
- Performed a focused D2 pass addressing trivial unused imports, unused variables, and small style inconsistencies across the src-tauri backend.
- Changes lowered the compiler warning count (progressively) and addressed noisy items that made it harder to focus on higher-priority work.
- Specific patterns that helped: prefer removing unused `use` lines, prefix intentionally-unused local variables with an underscore (e.g., `_optimizer`, `_description`), and remove public re-exports that are not needed (`pub use ...`) to reduce exported symbol noise.
- Not all warnings are equally safe to auto-fix; I prioritized clearly-trivial items (unused imports, obvious unused local variables, and harmless re-exports). I avoided touching dead-code that might be intentionally kept for serde compatibility.

Difficulties:
- Some remaining warnings require design decisions (private-interface warnings, static mutable references). These need careful refactors rather than blind fixes.
- A few files with large structs used for serde derive still show "field never read" warnings; these are safe to keep but should be reviewed when doing deeper cleanup.

Successes:
- Files updated during this D2 session:
  - src-tauri/src/database/optimization/mod.rs — removed unused imports.
  - src-tauri/src/database/backup.rs — removed unused chrono `TimeZone` import.
  - src-tauri/src/commands/projects.rs — validation fixes and prefixed intentionally-unused binding.
  - src-tauri/src/database/operations/collaboration.rs — removed unused `Row` import.
  - src-tauri/src/models/mod.rs — removed unused public re-exports (`ai_card`, `story_bible`).
  - src-tauri/src/ai/write_processor.rs — removed unused imports and tightened usage.
  - src-tauri/src/commands/performance_optimization.rs — prefixed unused streaming optimizer binding.
- Current cargo check results: 42 warnings remain across src-tauri (no compilation errors).
- These changes keep the code behavior unchanged while reducing compiler noise and improving signal-to-noise for future passes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Run `cargo fix --lib -p storyweaver` to auto-apply safe fixes and then do a manual review for remaining items.
- Triage remaining warnings by category and ownership; assign the `static_mut_refs` and private-interface items to an engineer with deeper knowledge of lifetimes and visibility patterns.
- Consider a CI job that enforces a warning budget and blocks merges that increase the warning count.

Files Modified (D2 session):
- src-tauri/src/database/optimization/mod.rs
- src-tauri/src/database/backup.rs
- src-tauri/src/commands/projects.rs
- src-tauri/src/database/operations/collaboration.rs
- src-tauri/src/models/mod.rs
- src-tauri/src/ai/write_processor.rs
- src-tauri/src/commands/performance_optimization.rs

TaskRef: "D2 - Clippy & Minor Fixes (manual follow-up)"

Learnings:
- Ran `cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --lib -p storyweaver` and inspected results.
- The auto-fixer applied many suggestions but left three compile errors caused by ambiguous integer literals used with `.saturating_sub(...)` in AI provider rate limiter code. These occurred in:
  - `src-tauri/src/ai/openai.rs`
  - `src-tauri/src/ai/claude.rs`
  - `src-tauri/src/ai/gemini.rs`
- Manually fixed those ambiguous literal issues by explicitly typing the literal as `60000_u64.saturating_sub(elapsed)` in each of the three provider files.
- Addressed doc-comment blank-line warnings by converting a small top-level doc comment into a regular comment in `src-tauri/src/database/operations/series_consistency_ops.rs` (to avoid the empty doc-comment line that clippy flagged).
- Re-ran `cargo clippy -p storyweaver` to validate the changes; the build completed successfully. Clippy still reports a large number of warnings (~714) across the crate; this is expected for a big codebase and will be addressed incrementally.
- Made other small, safe edits as-needed to match clippy guidance where low-risk (e.g., replacing pattern that caused an immediate error vs. stylistic suggestions which were deferred).

Difficulties:
- Clippy's automatic fix can't apply every suggestion; when fixes interact with ambiguous numeric types the auto-fixer may leave incomplete edits that require manual intervention.
- Many clippy warnings are stylistic or involve design decisions (e.g., static mutable references, API surface changes). These require human review and cannot be auto-fixed reliably.

Successes:
- Resolved the three compile errors introduced after the auto-fixer run (ambiguous numeric literal issues) so the crate compiles cleanly.
- Removed at least one source of repeated doc-comment warnings.
- Verified crate builds and completed a clippy run to confirm the changes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Next recommended steps (user-provided D2 plan):
  1. Run `cargo fix --lib -p storyweaver` and review automated suggestions; commit safe fixes.
  2. Audit dead-code fields and either remove them or annotate with `#[allow(dead_code)]` where used only by serde/debug (this requires code-owner review).
  3. Run `cargo clippy` and address style/type suggestions in small, reviewed batches.
  4. Final pass: aim to reduce warnings to <20 and close D2; optional target 0–10 warnings for a clean baseline.
- I paused after the manual fixes per your instruction; no further edits will be made until you request them.

Files Modified in this manual follow-up:
- src-tauri/src/ai/claude.rs
- src-tauri/src/ai/openai.rs
- src-tauri/src/ai/gemini.rs
- src-tauri/src/database/operations/series_consistency_ops.rs

Date: 2025-08-14
TaskRef: "D2 - Session Summary & Pause"

Learnings:
- Manual fixes are sometimes required after `cargo clippy --fix` — especially for ambiguous literals and doc-comment formatting.
- Large codebases accumulate stylistic warnings that should be triaged by category and owner; automated fixes help but human review is essential for semantic safety.
- Keeping a running raw reflection log helps preserve the rationale for each change and next steps for future passes.

Difficulties:
- Many warnings remain; further work should be planned as small, reviewable tasks to avoid regressions.

Successes:
- Fixed three compile-blocking issues and reduced some warnings.
- Recorded this session's learnings and next steps in the memory bank (this file).

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Proceed with the D2 recommended plan when ready; consider breaking it into checklist PRs to keep changes reviewable.

Files Modified During This Session (quick reference):
- src-tauri/src/ai/claude.rs
- src-tauri/src/ai/openai.rs
- src-tauri/src/ai/gemini.rs
- src-tauri/src/database/operations/series_consistency_ops.rs
- Additional D2 items previously updated as listed above.
