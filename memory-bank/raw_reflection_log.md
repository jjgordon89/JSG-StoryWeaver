TaskRef: "Review Phase 2 Core Writing Features plan and update progress"

Learnings:
- Discovered that initial work on Phase 2 has already begun, with several key components partially implemented.
- Found that the AI provider abstraction layer has been implemented with a comprehensive trait-based interface that defines methods for various writing features (Write, Rewrite, Expand, Describe, Brainstorm, etc.).
- Learned that basic integrations for OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini providers have been created, but they need to be completed with full streaming support and proper error handling.
- Observed that a basic WriteProcessor has been implemented with support for auto_write, guided_write, and tone_shift_write modes, but it needs to be connected to the frontend and enhanced with streaming support.
- Found that the Card System UI has been implemented for displaying AI responses with stacking, filtering, and sorting capabilities, but it's currently using mock data and needs to be connected to the backend.
- Identified that basic token counting and credit calculation have been implemented, but a comprehensive credit management system is still needed.
- Learned that the focus mode feature, which was originally planned for Phase 2, has already been implemented as part of Phase 1.
- Discovered that the state synchronization system and background processing queue, which are prerequisites for some Phase 2 features, have already been implemented.

Difficulties:
- Initial challenge in determining the exact status of Phase 2 implementation since it wasn't clearly documented. Resolved by examining the source code files (ai/mod.rs, ai/write_processor.rs, etc.) to understand what has been implemented.
- Difficulty in assessing the completeness of the AI provider implementations since they involve multiple files and complex interfaces. Resolved by analyzing the trait definitions and implementation details.
- Challenge in creating an accurate updated plan that reflects both what has been completed and what remains to be done. Resolved by creating a detailed checklist with clear completion indicators.

Successes:
- Successfully created an updated Phase 2 plan that accurately reflects the current progress and remaining tasks.
- Identified and documented the specific components that have been implemented and those that still need work.
- Created a clear roadmap for continuing the Phase 2 implementation with prioritized next steps.
- Updated all relevant documentation files (activeContext.md, progress.md, changelog.md) to maintain consistency.
- Organized the Phase 2 progress into logical categories (AI Provider Framework, Core Systems, Writing Tools, UI Components) for better tracking.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Parallel development pattern: Effectively manage the transition between project phases by allowing initial work on the next phase to begin while completing the final tasks of the current phase.
- Component status tracking: Use a consistent system for tracking the status of individual components within a larger feature (e.g., ✅ for completed, ⏳ for in progress).
- AI provider abstraction pattern: Design AI service integrations with a trait-based approach that defines a common interface for all providers, allowing for easy addition of new providers and features.
- Documentation-code synchronization: Ensure that documentation is updated whenever significant code changes are made, especially when implementing features ahead of schedule.

TaskRef: "Comprehensive Codebase Review - Critical Error Analysis and Problem Identification"

Learnings:
- **Critical Dependency Issue**: Discovered that `advancedAIStore.ts` imports from 'pinia' but Pinia is not installed as a dependency, causing TypeScript compilation failures.
- **State Management Inconsistency**: Found that the codebase uses multiple state management libraries inconsistently - Zustand for most stores, attempted Pinia for advancedAI, and Svelte stores in a React application.
- **Rust Compilation Failures**: Identified 384 compilation errors in the Rust backend, primarily in `plugin.rs` with lifetime issues, type mismatches, and database schema problems.
- **Database Schema Mismatches**: Discovered 15+ critical schema mismatches affecting `generated_images`, `brainstorm_sessions`, and `outline_templates` tables.
- **Framework Architecture Issues**: Found Vue components (`.vue` files) being used in a React application, creating build and runtime conflicts.
- **Type Safety Violations**: Identified multiple type conversion errors between Rust database types (i64) and expected String types.
- **Missing Environment Variables**: Found that `DATABASE_URL` is missing, causing SQLx macro compilation failures.

Difficulties:
- **Complex Error Diagnosis**: Initial challenge in understanding why TypeScript was reporting property access errors on correctly defined interfaces. Resolved by discovering the missing Pinia dependency.
- **Multi-Language Error Correlation**: Difficulty correlating frontend TypeScript errors with backend Rust compilation issues. Resolved by systematic analysis of both build systems.
