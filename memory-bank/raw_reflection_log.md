TaskRef: "Troubleshoot Tauri development server startup issues"

Learnings:
- Discovered that Tauri 2.0 has a very strict configuration for plugins in `tauri.conf.json`.
- The `scope` field in the `fs` plugin is deprecated and has been replaced with `allow`.
- For many plugins, simply enabling them with `true` or an empty object `{}` is not sufficient. The correct way to enable a plugin with no configuration is to remove it from the `plugins` object entirely.
- When troubleshooting a series of cascading errors, it can be effective to strip the configuration down to a minimal working state and then re-introduce components one by one.

Difficulties:
- I was stuck in a loop of fixing one plugin's configuration only to have the next one fail. This was due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how to configure plugins in Tauri 2.0.
- The error messages were not always clear about the correct configuration, leading to a trial-and-error approach.

Successes:
- I was able to successfully start the development server after removing all the problematic plugins from the `tauri.conf.json` file.
- I was able to correctly identify the root cause of the issue, even though it took several attempts.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When troubleshooting a series of cascading errors, it can be effective to strip the configuration down to a minimal working state and then re-introduce components one by one.
- Tauri 2.0: Plugin configuration is very strict. When in doubt, start with a minimal configuration and add plugins back one by one.

TaskRef: "Implement project management interface"

Learnings:
- Implemented the three-column responsive UI layout using Tailwind CSS.
- Created the project management interface with placeholder data.
- Used Radix UI components for the base UI components.

Difficulties:
- None at this time.

Successes:
- Successfully implemented the three-column layout.
- Successfully created the project management interface.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When implementing a new UI component, start with a simple placeholder and then replace it with functional components in subsequent tasks.
