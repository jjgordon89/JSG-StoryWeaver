TaskRef: "Review Phase 2 Core Writing Features plan and update progress"

Learnings:
- Discovered that initial work on Phase 2 has already begun, with several key components partially implemented.
- Found that the AI provider abstraction layer has been implemented with a comprehensive trait-based interface that defines methods for various writing features (Write, Rewrite, Expand, Describe, Brainstorm, etc.).
- Learned that basic integrations for OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini providers have been created, but they need to be completed with full streaming support and proper error handling.
- Observed that a basic WriteProcessor has been implemented with support for auto_write, guided_write, and tone_shift_write modes, but it needs to be connected to the frontend and enhanced with streaming support.
- Found that the Card System UI has been implemented for displaying AI responses with stacking, filtering, and sorting capabilities, but it's currently using mock data and needs to be connected to the backend.
- Identified that basic token counting and credit calculation have been implemented, but a comprehensive credit management system is still needed.
- Learned that the focus mode feature, which was originally planned for Phase 2, has already been implemented as part of Phase 1.
- Discovered that the state synchronization system and background processing queue, which are prerequisites for some Phase 2 features, have already been implemented.

Difficulties:
- Initial challenge in determining the exact status of Phase 2 implementation since it wasn't clearly documented. Resolved by examining the source code files (ai/mod.rs, ai/write_processor.rs, etc.) to understand what has been implemented.
- Difficulty in assessing the completeness of the AI provider implementations since they involve multiple files and complex interfaces. Resolved by analyzing the trait definitions and implementation details.
- Challenge in creating an accurate updated plan that reflects both what has been completed and what remains to be done. Resolved by creating a detailed checklist with clear completion indicators.

Successes:
- Successfully created an updated Phase 2 plan that accurately reflects the current progress and remaining tasks.
- Identified and documented the specific components that have been implemented and those that still need work.
- Created a clear roadmap for continuing the Phase 2 implementation with prioritized next steps.
- Updated all relevant documentation files (activeContext.md, progress.md, changelog.md) to maintain consistency.
- Organized the Phase 2 progress into logical categories (AI Provider Framework, Core Systems, Writing Tools, UI Components) for better tracking.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Parallel development pattern: Effectively manage the transition between project phases by allowing initial work on the next phase to begin while completing the final tasks of the current phase.
- Component status tracking: Use a consistent system for tracking the status of individual components within a larger feature (e.g., ✅ for completed, ⏳ for in progress).
- AI provider abstraction pattern: Design AI service integrations with a trait-based approach that defines a common interface for all providers, allowing for easy addition of new providers and features.
- Documentation-code synchronization: Ensure that documentation is updated whenever significant code changes are made, especially when implementing features ahead of schedule.

TaskRef: "Review Phase 1 Foundation plan completion status"

Learnings:
- Discovered that the project is further along than the documentation indicated, with Phase 1 at ~99% completion rather than ~95%.
- Identified that many items previously marked as incomplete in the Phase 1 plan have actually been completed, including backend integration for folder hierarchy, series management, document linking, database backup, trash management, document version history, focus mode, state persistence, state synchronization, background processing, and performance monitoring.
- Found that the only remaining tasks for Phase 1 are: implementing project preview functionality, creating UI components for backup/trash/version history management, and performing end-to-end testing of backend-UI integration.
- Learned that the memory bank files (progress.md, activeContext.md, changelog.md) need to be kept in sync with the project plan files to maintain a consistent view of the project status.
- Observed that the project has a well-organized structure for tracking progress, with clear separation between completed, incomplete, and deferred tasks.

Difficulties:
- Initial confusion about the actual completion status due to discrepancies between the Phase 1 plan and the memory bank files. Resolved by cross-referencing multiple sources (progress.md, activeContext.md) to determine the true status.
- Challenge in determining which items were truly incomplete versus which were marked incorrectly. Resolved by examining the open tabs in VSCode which showed that many of the "incomplete" features had corresponding implementation files.

Successes:
- Successfully updated all relevant documentation files to reflect the accurate completion status of Phase 1.
- Created a clear, prioritized list of the remaining tasks needed before moving to Phase 2.
- Maintained consistency across all documentation files (Phase1-Foundation.md, progress.md, activeContext.md, changelog.md).
- Used a systematic approach to cross-reference information from multiple sources to build an accurate picture of the project status.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Documentation synchronization pattern: When updating project plans, ensure all related documentation files are updated simultaneously to maintain consistency.
- Progress tracking pattern: Use consistent symbols (✅, ⏳) across all documentation to clearly indicate completion status.
- Project phase transition checklist: Create a standardized checklist for transitioning between project phases, including documentation updates, final testing, and preparation for the next phase.

TaskRef: "Story Bible Integration with Project Context"

Learnings:
- React Context pattern is effective for sharing state across non-adjacent components in the component tree
- ProjectContext with selectedProjectId and setSelectedProjectId provides clean state management for project selection
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in Vite works seamlessly during development, allowing real-time updates
- TypeScript compilation errors must be resolved for React components to render properly
- User experience is improved by showing helpful messages when required data (project selection) is missing

Difficulties:
- Initial compilation errors due to remaining references to old `selectedProject` variable after refactoring
- Required careful tracking of all variable references across multiple files during state management refactoring
- Development server was running on port 1420 instead of expected 5173, causing initial preview connection issues

Successes:
- Successfully created a centralized project context that can be reused across the application
- Story Bible component now properly receives project context and can load project-specific data
- Clean separation of concerns with ProjectProvider wrapping the entire app
- User-friendly UI feedback when no project is selected
- All compilation errors resolved and application runs smoothly

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- React Context pattern for cross-component state sharing
- Systematic approach to refactoring state management (update imports, state declarations, references, and dependencies)
- Importance of checking all variable references when renaming state variables
- User experience considerations for conditional rendering based on required data availability

TaskRef: "Story Bible System Analysis - Missing Features Assessment"

## Task Summary
**Objective**: Comprehensive analysis of StoryWeaver's Story Bible system to identify missing features and implementation gaps
**Context**: Continuing analysis of the Story Bible system after examining braindump, POV/Tense settings, and character functionality
**Approach**: Systematic codebase search and documentation review across all Story Bible components

## Technical Insights
### Story Bible System Status
- **Implemented Features**: Basic CRUD operations, AI generation, CSV export, character relationships, POV/Tense UI components
- **Character System**: Has trait types (physical, personality, background) but lacks template/archetype system
- **Worldbuilding System**: Has predefined element types (location, organization, culture, etc.) but no customizable template system
- **CSV Export**: Fully implemented across CharactersManager, WorldBuildingManager, ScenesManager, OutlineManager
- **POV/Tense Settings**: UI components exist in BraindumpEditor.tsx with Select components for POV mode and global tense

### Missing Features Identified
1. **Template Systems**:
   - Character templates and archetypes - no implementation found
   - Worldbuilding customizable card templates - missing despite Phase3 requirements
   - Template selection for story structures

2. **Import Functionality**:
   - CSV import functionality - planned but not implemented
   - Character import from text/files (60K words, 30 chars max) - missing
   - Smart import features for bulk data entry
   - Novel import with auto-populated Story Bible

3. **Visualization Features**:
   - Graph-based relationship visualization for characters and worldbuilding
   - Hierarchical worldbuilding organization
   - Network diagrams for story element relationships

4. **Advanced Organization**:
   - Hierarchical worldbuilding organization
   - Advanced template systems across components
   - Customizable card structures

### Code Structure Analysis
- **Database Models**: WorldElement and Character models support basic functionality but lack template fields
- **UI Components**: React and Svelte versions exist with consistent functionality
- **Backend Support**: Rust backend has placeholder comments for import migrations
- **Reference Documentation**: sw-characters.md and sw-worldbuilding.md describe template functionality not yet implemented

## Problem-Solving Analysis
### Challenges Encountered
- **Issue**: Distinguishing between planned vs implemented features
- **Root Cause**: Phase3-StoryBibleSystem.md contains both completed and incomplete tasks
- **Resolution**: Cross-referenced documentation with actual code implementation
- **Prevention**: Always verify documentation claims against actual codebase

### Research Strategy
- **Effective Approach**: Systematic search across multiple file types (TypeScript, Rust, Markdown)
- **Key Discovery**: CSV export is complete but import is missing across all components
- **Pattern Recognition**: Template systems are consistently missing despite being core requirements

## Success Factors
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Analyzed all Story Bible components systematically
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verified documentation against actual implementation
- **Clear Gap Identification**: Distinguished between UI placeholders and functional implementation
- **Structured Analysis**: Organized findings by feature category for actionable insights

## Consolidation Candidates
- **Pattern**: Template system gaps across multiple components indicate architectural need
- **Import Strategy**: CSV import infrastructure needs to be built from scratch
- **Visualization Gap**: Graph-based features require new UI components and data structures
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Need to validate planned features against actual implementation
