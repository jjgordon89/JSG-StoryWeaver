TaskRef: "Implement RUST_CODEBASE_FIXES_REQUIRED.md - Step 1 (Error type/Result/factory fixes batch 1)"

Learnings:
- Batch refactoring of Tauri command handlers to use error factory functions (e.g. StoryWeaverError::project_not_found) for NotFound-style patterns, per the new error type protocol.
- For most recent handlers (e.g., series_commands.rs, project_preview_commands.rs), error construction for NotFound is now routed through a dedicated factory (e.g. StoryWeaverError::series_not_found, project_not_found).
- Non-use of direct NotFound variant pattern was observed in some handlers (e.g., folder_commands.rs, document_link_commands.rs). Confirmed these required no update.
- Protocol: Always perform a regex search to safely audit and scope locations needing NotFound/NotFound factory pattern upgrades, as prior assumptions based on filename may be incorrect.

Difficulties:
- Required careful contextual search to avoid unnecessary refactors (some files already compliant or using different error styles).
- Large file makes search/replace log updates sensitive to marker positioning—must use narrow, safe blocks to avoid tool failures.

Successes:
- Consistent error factory style achieved across top-priority command handler files per spec.
- Improved diagnostic repeatability and audit trace of fix batch, ready for future contributors.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Develop a short grep/search script or CI pre-check that flags any direct usage of NotFound error variants in handler and operation modules, to enforce ongoing correctness and style.

TaskRef: "Apply error factory pattern for not_found in src-tauri/src/commands/plugin.rs (per RUST_CODEBASE_FIXES_REQUIRED.md)"

Learnings:
- Direct construction of complex error enum types (`StoryWeaverError::NotFound { ... }`) was replaced with the error factory function (`StoryWeaverError::not_found(...)`) to ensure maintainability and centralized logic.
- RUST_CODEBASE_FIXES_REQUIRED.md mandates using factory functions for error creation, ensuring future changes to error construction require edits only in one place (the factory function).
- The search/replace pattern is clear: replace occurrences of `.ok_or_else(|| StoryWeaverError::NotFound { ... })` with `.ok_or_else(|| StoryWeaverError::not_found(...))`, passing the same info as arguments.
- This fix pattern should be uniformly preferred to encourage clean error propagation and easier refactoring.

Difficulties:
- No major obstacles in this instance, as the error factory already existed and required only usage correction.

Successes:
- Confirmed that centralizing error construction through well-named factory methods simplifies the code and future error handling changes.
- Served as a prototype fix for similar patterns identified across the wider codebase.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Always use error factory functions for constructing complex error types (especially for variants reused in many locations).
- Audit and replace direct struct/variant error constructions with factory method calls for future error resilience.

TaskRef: "Fix markdownlint warning in consolidated_learnings.md (Heading level)"

Learnings:
- Markdownlint rule MD041 requires the first line of all markdown docs (especially central conventions) to be a level 1 heading (`# ...`).
- Even internal dev docs or summary pattern files should observe this style to prevent CI or linter failures across diverse environments or editors.

Difficulties:
- None in this instance; direct format upgrade was sufficient.

Successes:
- Used targeted replace_in_file operation to minimize diff risk and preserve the integrity of the rest of the doc.
- Confirmed that replacing "##" with "#" at the start efficiently resolves MD041 with no disruption to context or meaning.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Generalize: Always start markdown docs with a level 1 heading to pass MD041.

TaskRef: "Identify and Document Root Causes/Fixes for Rust Codebase Errors"

Learnings:
- Multiple root causes contribute to ongoing errors: inconsistent Result alias usage, missing error factory functions, struct variant misuse, incorrect command return types, DB type mismatches, improper Option handling, incomplete From trait implementations.
- The codebase uses a single-argument Result<T> alias for StoryWeaverError, but much code expects Result<T, E>, causing broad breakages.
- Error construction patterns are inconsistent, leading to propagation and handler type mismatches.
- Database model field and query mismatches are a recurring issue.
- Some errors arise from .await on non-async code or missing async functions.
- Option<T> vs. T type divergences, especially in DB and model logic, result in subtle runtime or compile errors.

Difficulties:
- Correlating command handler signatures with actual inner logic is time-consuming due to return type drift and overloading.
- Some legacy function signatures must be fully refactored before fixing internal logic, which requires staged implementation.
- Locating all misuses of Result or error construction in a large codebase demands careful review.

Successes:
- Broad error pattern and type mismatch themes have been distilled into a categorized fix plan.
- Created a cross-referenced and actionable markdown file for prioritized remediation, aiding contributors and maintainers.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Standardize error construction with factory functions for every reused variant—use as default pattern.
- Consistently use Result<T> as defined by project (prefer over std::result::Result<T, E>) for internal error type.
- Make CommandResponse<T> the only return pattern for Tauri command handlers, converting from internal Result<T> logic.
- All struct field initializations and Option handling should use explicit .map(), .unwrap_or(), or direct assignment for type clarity.
