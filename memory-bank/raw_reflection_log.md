TaskRef: "Register OpenAIProvider in backend state (Phase 2 Foundation)"

Learnings:
- Registered AIProviderManager with OpenAIProvider in Tauri's state, making modular AI providers accessible to backend commands.
- Demonstrated how to initialize and manage provider state at application startup for extensibility.
- Used Arc for thread-safe provider sharing across async contexts.

Difficulties:
- Syntax error due to misplaced import; resolved by moving Arc import to the top-level imports.

Successes:
- The backend is now ready for modular, runtime-configurable AI provider usage.
- This pattern supports future provider registration and dynamic selection.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: Store provider managers in Tauri state for global backend access.
- Project-specific: Always place imports at the top-level to avoid attribute-related syntax errors.

TaskRef: "Implement OpenAIProvider as modular AI backend (Phase 2 Foundation)"

Learnings:
- Implemented OpenAIProvider struct and trait for modular AI integration, following the AIProvider abstraction.
- Demonstrated the pattern for adding new AI providers: create a new file, implement the trait, and register in the ai module.
- This pattern enables easy extension for Claude, Gemini, and other providers.
- Re-exporting providers via the ai module simplifies usage and testing across the backend.

Difficulties:
- None for this step; the abstraction and trait pattern made implementation straightforward.

Successes:
- The codebase now supports modular, plug-and-play AI provider development.
- OpenAIProvider is scaffolded and ready for real API integration.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: Use a dedicated module and trait for each AI provider, re-export via a central ai module for extensibility.
- Project-specific: Scaffold each new provider as a separate file, following the trait interface for consistency and testability.

TaskRef: "Scaffold modular AI provider abstraction (Phase 2 Foundation)"

Learnings:
- Successfully scaffolded an AIProvider trait and AIProviderManager struct in Rust for modular AI integration.
- Used the async_trait crate to enable async functions in trait objects, which is required for AI providers with async methods.
- Confirmed that async_trait resolves dyn compatibility for async trait methods, allowing for flexible provider registration and invocation.
- The abstraction will enable plugging in OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and other providers with minimal friction.

Difficulties:
- Initial dyn compatibility errors when using async functions in traits; resolved by using async_trait and confirming correct import and crate usage.
- Needed to ensure the crate was added to Cargo.toml and imported as async_trait::async_trait.

Successes:
- cargo check succeeded with only warnings after the changes, confirming the abstraction is ready for further AI integration.
- The codebase is now ready for modular, testable AI provider development.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: Use async_trait for async trait object safety in Rust when designing plugin/provider abstractions.
- Project-specific: Scaffold AI provider abstractions early to enable modular, testable AI integrations for all future features.

TaskRef: "Troubleshoot Tauri development server startup issues"

Learnings:
- Discovered that Tauri 2.0 has a very strict configuration for plugins in `tauri.conf.json`.
- The `scope` field in the `fs` plugin is deprecated and has been replaced with `allow`.
- For many plugins, simply enabling them with `true` or an empty object `{}` is not sufficient. The correct way to enable a plugin with no configuration is to remove it from the `plugins` object entirely.
- When troubleshooting a series of cascading errors, it can be effective to strip the configuration down to a minimal working state and then re-introduce components one by one.

Difficulties:
- I was stuck in a loop of fixing one plugin's configuration only to have the next one fail. This was due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how to configure plugins in Tauri 2.0.
- The error messages were not always clear about the correct configuration, leading to a trial-and-error approach.

Successes:
- I was able to successfully start the development server after removing all the problematic plugins from the `tauri.conf.json` file.
- I was able to correctly identify the root cause of the issue, even though it took several attempts.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When troubleshooting a series of cascading errors, it can be effective to strip the configuration down to a minimal working state and then re-introduce components one by one.
- Tauri 2.0: Plugin configuration is very strict. When in doubt, start with a minimal configuration and add plugins back one by one.

TaskRef: "Implement project management interface"

Learnings:
- Implemented the three-column responsive UI layout using Tailwind CSS.
- Created the project management interface with placeholder data.
- Used Radix UI components for the base UI components.

Difficulties:
- None at this time.

Successes:
- Successfully implemented the three-column layout.
- Successfully created the project management interface.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When implementing a new UI component, start with a simple placeholder and then replace it with functional components in subsequent tasks.
