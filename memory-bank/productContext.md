# Product Context: StoryWeaver

## Problem Space
Writers often juggle multiple tools to manage their projects: a word processor for writing, a separate application for notes and world-building, and another for organizing plot points and character arcs. This fragmentation can disrupt the creative flow and lead to scattered, disorganized information.

## Core Purpose
StoryWeaver aims to solve this by providing a single, integrated environment that brings together all aspects of the writing process. It is designed to be a "second brain" for writers, allowing them to focus on creativity while the tool handles the organization.

## User Experience Goals
- **Seamless Flow:** The user should be able to move effortlessly between writing, reviewing notes, and using AI tools without leaving the application.
- **Minimal Distraction:** The UI should be clean and unobtrusive, with a "focus mode" to eliminate distractions during writing sessions.
- **Empowering, Not Overwhelming:** AI tools should feel like a natural extension of the writing process, offering assistance without being prescriptive or getting in the way.
- **Sense of Security:** Users should trust that their work is always saved and secure, thanks to a robust auto-save and backup system.
- **Project Management:** The project management interface should be intuitive and easy to use, allowing writers to organize their projects with ease.
