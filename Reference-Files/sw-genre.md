Literary Realism
✨
Pro-tip!
Is the AI writing romance that’s a little too mushy? Change it to romantic, or avoid it altogether. In general, expanding upon or changing out your genres can help the AI get away from overly tropey writing.
Genre is filled in manually, and thus is not informed by any other Story Bible fields. Meanwhile, the Genre influences Synopsis, Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).
