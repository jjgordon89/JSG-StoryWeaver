Style
Style affects the tone, word choice, and sentence structure the Story Bible uses. What you put here has the most influence on Prose.

✏️
Examples
Lush prose
Spare and haunting. Written in short sentences with lots of menacing dialogue.
Whimsical and dense
Action-packed and violent
3rd-person objective POV
✨
Pro-tip!
While not necessary, Sudowrite experts recommend tweaking both your Genre and Style boxes in advance of generating a particular chapter, so that you can really dial-in a specific tone. Style in particular has a big impact on prose.
Style is filled in manually—or by using the Match My Style feature—and is not informed by any other Story Bible fields. Style directly influences both Beat and Chapter generation.
