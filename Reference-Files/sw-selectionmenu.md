Selection Menu
 
One of the most powerful tools on Sudowrite is hidden until you highlight somethingâ€”and itâ€™s called the Selection Menu.

 
This smart menu will appear, hovering over your document, once youâ€™ve selected text. It will change based on what exactly youâ€™ve highlighted. For example, highlight a single word and youâ€™ll have the option to use Describe, open Quick Edit, or select from Related Words. Meanwhile, choose a longer selection of text and youâ€™ll get options such as Rewrite, Expand, or Visualize as well.

 
In some cases the Selection Menu is a quicker and easier way to access the toolbar toolsâ€”like Rewrite or Describe. But in other cases, the Selection Menu is the primary (or exclusive) way to access a feature. The features that are primarily accessed via the Selection Menu are:

 
Related Words - This feature is a smart thesaurus. A handful of related words will appear in the Selection Menu when youâ€™ve selected a single word, but you also have the option to expand and view a full Related Words word cloud.

Expand - Take a selection of text and make it longer and more detailed.

Visualize - Visualize can be used to generate an image from a passage of text.

Quick Edit - While there is a keyboard shortcut for the Quick Tools as well, Quick Edit will always appear as an option in the Selection Menuâ€”whether youâ€™re selecting a single word or an extended passage.

Welcome back to our Quick Start series. Today, we'll be diving in on Sudowriteâ€™s Selection Menu and Quick Tools.

Did you know there are a few secret features on Sudowrite? Theyâ€™re not really secret, but they are sort of hidden in plain sight. They live in what we call the Selection Menu. The Selection Menu appears when youâ€™ve highlighted a selection of text.

Itâ€™s actually a pretty smart menuâ€”it will only ever be populated with options that are appropriate for the text that youâ€™ve highlighted. Hereâ€™s what I mean: Highlight a single word, and youâ€™ll see a few alternatives that you might find in a Thesaurus. Click on 15 More, and youâ€™ll open a panel that we call Related Words, with even more suggestions available. You can select another wordâ€”either directly from the Selection Menu or from Related Words hereâ€”for a quick inline replacement.

With a single word selected, you also have the option to either Describe or Quick Edit. Weâ€™ve already reviewed the Describe function, and Iâ€™m sure you can imagine how getting some sensory details might be applicable to a single word. Weâ€™ll look at Quick Edit in just a momentâ€”

But firstâ€¦ notice how when you highlight a full paragraph, the Selection Menu changes. Joining Describe and Quick Edit are Rewriteâ€”which weâ€™ve already coveredâ€”Expand, and Visualize.

Clicking Visualize will generate an image inspired by your selected prose. Just like all of Sudowriteâ€™s other AI features, the results of Visualize will show up in a card in the History column on the right.

Meanwhile, Expand will take a selection of text and make it longer while adding some new details. As you can see with my selection here, I had a very brief paragraph where someone left the orchard for home, and after Expanding this it has slowed the action into a more methodical and detailed journey.
