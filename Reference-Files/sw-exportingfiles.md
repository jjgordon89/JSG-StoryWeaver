Sudowrite offers a few different ways to export your work, allowing you to easily save individual files, projects, or Story Bible sections.

Project Export
Need to backup your entire project or share all of the documents with a collaborator? The Project Export feature is perfect for these scenarios. It allows you to export all of your documents at once as a bundled .zip file.

Select "Export (.zip)" from the dropdown menu.
Project Export Features:

Document Export
Sometimes you only need to export a specific chapter or single document from your project. The Document Export option allows you to do just that, giving you flexibility in sharing or backing up individual pieces of your work.

Note that if youâ€™re primarily looking to export a document in order to share it with a collaborator, you may be better served by using Sudowriteâ€™s Document Sharing functionality. Details on Document Sharing, and the collaboration feature we call Clean Copy, are available here: Collaboration Options 

Story Bible Export
Neither Project Export nor Document Export include your Story Bible contents by default. Some authors choose to copy and paste those fields into a document manually in order to export them, but two sections of the Story Bible have their own Export functionalities.

Outline Export:

Click the three dot (â€¢â€¢â€¢) menu option in the Outline section header of your Story Bible
Youâ€™ll be presented an Export option
Once Exported, youâ€™ll receive a two-column .CSV file with your chapter names in the left column and corresponding chapter summaries in the right column
Characters Export:

Click the three dot (â€¢â€¢â€¢) menu option in the Characters section header of your Story Bible
Youâ€™ll be presented an Export option
Once Exported, youâ€™ll receive a .CSV file with all of your characters represented as rows, and all of your default and custom traits represented as columns
