Canvas
If youâ€™re the type of author that works visuallyâ€”say using index cards to map out an outlineâ€”you may want to use Sudowriteâ€™s Canvas feature. Think of Canvas as a flexible digital whiteboard where you can drop notes, draft outlines, and freely rearrange everything in a 2D space.

 
To access Canvas, click the Canvas button in the lower left portion of your projectâ€™s left bar. Doing so will bring you into a fresh Canvas, where youâ€™ll see the orientation information represented in the screenshot below. You can click and drag to select these cards in order to delete them all at once, or select something and delete it individually.

The menu at the bottom of Canvas allows you to add a card, add text, or add an outline.

Adding a card gives you a blank card, where you can type anything youâ€™d like to keep track of: some character information, some notes on a scene, or freeform ideas you donâ€™t want to forget.

Adding text lets you throw text directly onto the Canvas, which is helpful when you want to label a cluster of cards or otherwise leave annotations for yourself.

Adding an outline will place a complete outline directly onto your canvasâ€”represented as a series of linked cards. The outline types available in canvas are The Heroâ€™s Journey, Hollywood Beats, Story Circle, and Romance Outline. Each outline is represented with distinct visuals.

Canvas outlines are a bit different from those in Story Bible. In Canvas you can generate a full outline from your idea, whether itâ€™s a single sentence or several paragraphs. You can also use the three dot (â€¢â€¢â€¢) menu to copy that outline to your clipboard if you want to bring it back into a Sudowrite document or even your Story Bible.
