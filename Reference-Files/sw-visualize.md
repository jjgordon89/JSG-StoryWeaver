Visualize
What is Visualize?
Visualize is a feature that brings your writing to life by generating images based on your text. Whether you're describing a character, setting a scene, or painting a vivid landscape with your words, Visualize transforms your descriptions into visual representations‚Äîgiving you a new perspective on your work.

This feature is especially helpful for:

Seeing how readers might imagine your descriptions
Visualizing characters or settings to ensure consistency
Finding inspiration when you're stuck
Bridging the gap between written descriptions and visual imagination
How to use Visualize
Visualize appears in the Plugins dropdown menu when you have text selected in your document. Here's how to use it:

Select a passage of text (minimum 10 words) that contains descriptive content
Click on the Plugins dropdown in the toolbar
Select Visualize from the list
Wait a moment while our AI generates an image based on your selection
View the generated image in the right sidebar
Once your image appears, you can:

Insert it directly into your document
Save it to your computer
Favorite it for later reference

ICYMI: Visualize only appears when you have text selected. Make sure your selection contains enough descriptive detail (at least 10 words) for the best results.

For best results from Visualize
The quality of your generated images depends on the detail in your text. Here are some tips:

Be specific: Include colors, textures, lighting, and other visual details
Set the scene: Describe the environment and atmosphere
Focus on the most important elements: What do you want to stand out?
Keep it cohesive: Conflicting descriptions might result in unusual images
For example, instead of:
"A castle on a hill."

Try:
"A gothic stone castle perched on a misty green hill, its dark spires piercing the dawn sky, with stained glass windows glinting in the morning light."

Essentially, use the same descriptive language you‚Äôd use when trying to conjure an image in your readers mind for best results.
