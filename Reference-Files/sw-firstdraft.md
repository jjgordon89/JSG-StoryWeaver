First Draft is a feature that helps you get the ball rolling when you don‚Äôt know where to begin. Whether you‚Äôre working on a novel, blog post, article, or essay, First Draft will generate up to 3000 words based on a prompt you provide‚Äîgiving you a solid jumping-off point to work from.

It‚Äôs intended for that early, idea-spark moment, before you‚Äôve written anything in the document. First Draft offers a substantial foundation you can then edit, refine, or build on.

How to use First Draft
First Draft only appears when your document is completely empty. Here‚Äôs how to find it:

Open a blank document inside any Sudowrite project.
Click on the Plugins dropdown in the toolbar.
Select First Draft from the list.
You‚Äôll see a field appear with some example prompts to inspire you below. Just complete that field and click Go!

For best results from First Draft
The more detail you provide, the better the draft will be. Here are a few tips:

Fiction? Include character names, settings, and key events.
Non-fiction? Share the structure or argument you want to make.
Something else? Mention tone, style, or any specific quirks you‚Äôd like to see.
We recommend giving as much detail as you can here. A sentence or two is fine, but a full paragraph is better. As you type, First Draft gives you feedback on how to improve your prompt‚Äîthink of it as a writing coach guiding you toward a stronger start.

What you can expect from First Draft
Once you submit your prompt, Sudowrite will stream a first draft directly into the editor. The draft is:

Tailored to the type of content you asked for (fiction or non-fiction)
Inserted as regular text, ready for immediate editing
Generated with beautiful sparkles‚Äîso you can follow along as it appears!
Whether it‚Äôs a moody short story opening or a structured blog article, First Draft gives you something real to react to.
