Sudowrite is the AI writing partner of your dreams, full of tools that help you get your ideas out of your head and onto the page.

Whether you want to start a new project or bring in a half-finished work, you can use Sudowrite for every step of your writing process‚Äîfrom brainstorming and planning to writing, editing, and beyond.

Use the Brainstorm tools to generate and collect fresh ideas, or just pop open quick chat to discuss your story.

Throw your unstructured ideas into Story Bible‚Äôs Braindump section and gradually expand that into a fully developed outline. Fill out these boxes manually, let Sudowrite do it for you, or collaborate with the AI.

With your Story Bible complete, you can generate Scenes, and after making sure they reflect your vision, turn those into full chapters of prose using the Chapter Generator.

If you‚Äôre more of a pantser than a plotter, use the Write button to get unstuck with inspired suggestions. And then use Expand to flesh things out, or Describe to add rich sensory details.

Finally, use Rewrite to dial in your voice‚Äîor Quick Edit to transform your prose according to  specific instructions.

When you‚Äôre done, you can even find Plugins that will help you write a query letter‚Äîso you can line up an agent to help you sell your masterpiece.

Planning, writing, revising, editing‚Ä¶ No matter where you could use support in your writing process, Sudowrite is there for you. Try it today for free at sudowrite.com

The Basics
Some necessary details on writing with help from AI

The world of AI-assisted writing is rapidly evolving and unlike anything before. So you‚Äôre probably wondering, how exactly does this thing work and how can I get the most out of it?

Like any tool, the person wielding it is ultimately responsible for the quality of results. This is a good thing because it means the writing you get from Sudowrite will be different from what everyone else gets, and there‚Äôs no limit to what you can create.

1.) Sudowrite works by reading your text, and then generating text based on what it sees.
This has a couple of important implications: 

The more you put in your document the better - Sudowrite needs to see enough content to understand what story you are trying to tell in order to give you good results. Try writing, or pasting in, at least a few paragraphs to get it started in the right direction.
Junk in, junk out - Sudowrite assumes that everything in your document is something that you like. That means that if you put suggestions you only kinda like into your document, Sudowrite will keep giving you more suggestions that you only kinda like. To get better suggestions, make sure what‚Äôs in the document is at the level you want.
The Write button looks at (at least) 1,000 words before your cursor - If there is important information you want Write to take into account before generating text, add it to the Key Details box in Write Settings‚Äîor your Story Bible. Or, in Guided mode, tell Sudowrite what to write and it will follow your instructions. Click the drop down arrow directly to the right of the Write button to find these options.
2.) Sudowrite is kind of random (on purpose)
Think of Sudowrite suggestions as pitches from a writing partner. You can take them, leave them, or improve them to get the best result. A ‚Äúyes, and‚Äù mindset is ideal for working with AI (just like with humans)!
Sometimes Sudowrite will say something that seems super random. That doesn‚Äôt mean you did anything wrong, or that there‚Äôs a problem with Sudowrite‚Äîbut it does suggest you should try to understand why the AI made that choice. Try a second time, and see if you get better results. If not, or if you find you have to press the button 3-5 times to get a result you like‚Ä¶ üëá
3.) There‚Äôs always a way to improve your results
Choosing the right feature can help you get better results
Write
Auto is for when you don‚Äôt know what should come next and you just want to see what the AI comes up with.
Guided is for when you have an idea of what should happen but want Sudowrite to draft it for you.
Describe adds rich sensory details‚Äîsight, sound, smell, touch, and taste‚Äîto any moment or object.
Rewrite improves phrasing, flow, or tone in an existing passage.
Brainstorm helps generate lists of ideas: names, powers, plot twists, worldbuilding elements, and more.
First Draft generates an extended scene (typically 500‚Äì1,000+ words) based on an outline or set of notes.
Expand adds length to your draft‚Äîwhether that means slowing pacing or fleshing out a moment. (Tip: Use Describe if what you need is added detail.)
Plugins are customizable tools that extend Sudowrite‚Äôs core functionality. Use them to tweak tone, change POV, enhance dialogue, and more.
Scenes (found in the Story Engine) are the new, structured way to outline and generate your chapters. Each scene focuses on a specific time, place, or POV, and supports Extra Instructions to guide tone, pacing, and style. Scenes fully replace the older Beats system.
If you‚Äôre not getting the kind of results you want after trying a few times - look at the input you gave Sudowrite. Ask yourself ‚ÄúWhy would Sudowrite think this is OK?‚Äù. You will probably be able to find a reason, or an opportunity to clarify.
Example: You are writing a werewolf story and you wrote that the moon is showing, but Sudowrite is not suggesting that the character turn into a werewolf. Isn‚Äôt it obvious that should happen? Solution: It turns out there was no mention of the werewolf aspect of this character in the previous 1,000 words, so Write did not know. You use Guided Write and tell Sudowrite to write the transformation, and it works perfectly.
If the writing you‚Äôre getting is not in your voice, look at your document and remove anything that isn‚Äôt a match to what you‚Äôd like Sudowrite to write for you. Or, use Rewrite to improve it.

We also have a full Quick Start video series available on YouTube. You can find the playlist at this link, but those videos are also embedded in this documentation where appropriate.

 
Onboarding to Sudowrite
When you first sign up for Sudowrite you‚Äôre dropped directly into a product tour that offers a guided walkthrough of some core features. If you breezed through that, or it‚Äôs just been a while and you‚Äôd like a refresher, you can always take that tour again.

 
To do so, just click on the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) up in the top right corner of the interface to access your Account Settings, then select Start Tour.

Whether you write novels or non-fiction, Sudowrite is the fastest way to get your ideas out of your head and onto the page‚Ä¶ but before you can get started, it helps to know your way around the software.

Today we‚Äôll review Sudowrite‚Äôs interface and features, and showcase how you can use it to brainstorm, write, edit, and stay organized.

For starters, I'm going to click this Home button in the upper left so we can start from the Sudowrite homepage. The homepage is where all of your projects appear.

Projects are represented by these little cards, which showcase a project title, a snippet from the first document inside of the project, a word count and an edited date. These three buttons expand a menu that will let you delete a project‚Äîand if you have deleted a project, you‚Äôll see a Trash over here. This is also where you‚Äôll find a Plugins button‚ÄîPlugins are user-created features, which are a bit more advanced, so we‚Äôll cover those in another video but feel free to explore them on your own too.

Down here on the right are some pinned resources and reference materials‚Äîfor example, this link to our live classes.

In the upper right here, you'll see a gear. This is the Settings for Sudowrite. If I expand it, I'll see my Account Details, but then also some Controls so I can customize my Sudowrite experience‚Äîeverything from the font and text size to line spacing to the actual color palette that Sudowrite uses here in the Theme.

Now I'm going to click into an existing project here to get started. Let‚Äôs begin by taking a quick look at the Sudowrite user interface. There are four main sections of it that you should know about. The primary section right here is the Editor. On its own, this rich text editor should look familiar, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. You‚Äôll see a Find & Replace button and formatting options along the top here.

Off to the right, you see a History section, which is where ‚Äúcards‚Äù with AI-generated text will appear when you use most of Sudowrite‚Äôs AI features. The card gives you the chance to review the AI-generated text before inserting it into your document, and you can always refer back to it‚Äîor even star it to save it in a short list for later.

In this left bar, you'll see the name of your project up top, and then all of the documents inside of your project down below. Documents are often chapters, but you can actually organize this section however you like. Your Documents will be titled automatically once you've written a sufficient amount inside of the body of the doc, but you can also rename them either by clicking on the three dots or by double-clicking the title. The same goes for your project title‚Äîrename it by clicking on it.

You can add a new document by clicking Add New, or you can upload an existing document from your computer.

The fourth section of the interface is the feature toolbar along the top. These are the main AI features of Sudowrite, which you can learn more about by hovering your cursor over‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôll dive into them right now.

Let‚Äôs start with Brainstorm. If I click on it, I'm prompted with this, which lets me select from any of the different things I could brainstorm. No matter what you select, the Brainstorm tool looks and works the same‚Äîit just changes the prepopulated sample text for your reference.

Click the refresh button to change the sample text up‚Äîor provide your own Brainstorm prompt.

Once I click Start, I'm sent directly into the Brainstorm flow. I can use the little thumbs up to add something to my keepers list, or the thumbs down if I don‚Äôt like something and want to receive a new suggestion. Once I have a Keepers list I'm happy with, I can click Save and Exit, and you'll see the results of that Brainstorm session appear in my history column.

There is another way to brainstorm, and that's by using what we call Quick Chat‚Äîone of Sudowrite‚Äôs Quick Tools. You‚Äôll find Quick Chat inside of the Quick Edit panel‚Äîand you can get to that from the hover menu that appears when you highlight something, or by using the keyboard shortcut, which is Control K on a PC or Command K on a Mac.

Opening that window allows you to toggle to what we call Quick Chat. This is where you can ask a question, say‚Ä¶ ask for some interesting settings for your Sci-Fi story. Quick Chat can see what you highlight, along with the context of your other documents, and make a suggestion.

Unlike Brainstorm, the results of a Quick Chat are not saved to your history, which means this is best for spur of the moment asks that you may not need to refer back to.

With Brainstorming out of the way, let‚Äôs look at Writing on Sudowrite. To help illustrate this next point, I‚Äôve added a sample story to this document. When writing it I got stuck‚Ä¶ but if I want Sudowrite to help me continue it, I just click the Write button.

The Write button is like a super advanced autocomplete that gives me suggestions on how to proceed. It won't change anything in the body of my document, but instead it will generate cards in the History column. If you want a little more control over how write works, you can click this arrow to the right of the button‚Äîhere you‚Äôll find Guided Write, which provides or accepts generalized suggestions on how to proceed, and Tone Shift, which works just like Write but in a tone that maps to whatever you select here. You also have full control over Write‚Äôs Auto mode here in the settings‚Ä¶ in case you wanted to crank up the creativity, change the length of the cards that are produced, or even toggle prose modes. (Prose modes will change the output a bit, since you‚Äôre essentially changing the AI that‚Äôs doing the work for you.)

Now, if in the course of writing you realize you need to flesh out some details, you can use what we call the Describe button. So if I highlight "ancient items and mystical objects" here, I can use the Describe button to get a more detailed description of those things. Clicking this dropdown to the right of Describe will show you all of the senses that Describe will generate a card for‚Äîif you don‚Äôt need to smell the high school locker room, make sure you toggle that off before clicking Describe on that phrase. When clicking Describe, you'll see the results in the right column just like other AI outputs. Along the bottom of each card here you‚Äôll see both an Insert and a Copy button, but you can also highlight any section that works for you, copy it, and just paste that into your document.

When it comes to editing your work, you have a few options available. I mentioned Quick Edit earlier‚Äîthat‚Äôs available from the hover menu when you highlight something, but also by the Command K / Control K shortcut. Quick Edit is about as simple as it gets‚Äîjust tell it what you want to change about your work. You can say ‚Äúexpand on this,‚Äù ‚Äúrephrase this‚Äù or ‚Äúchange this to first person.‚Äù You‚Äôll get a struck-through version of your original prose, and underlined in green you‚Äôll see the suggested replacement‚Äîwhich you can then accept, reject, or further edit by providing follow-up instructions.

The other main way to edit is with what we call the Rewrite button. Just highlight a section you‚Äôd like to rewrite, up to 6000 words, then click Rewrite. A Rewrite selector will appear in the History bar, where you‚Äôll choose how you want the Rewrite to work‚Äîshorter, more show, not tell, or even if I want to do something custom. So I can customize this and say, be more quirky or make this really dark and foreboding. For now, let's just use rephrase. When I say go, Rewrite gets to work. And you'll see the rephrase suggestion appears in my right column here. If I like what I see and I click Insert, it replaces the text that I already had highlighted.

Finally, when it comes to staying organized on SudoWrite, there are two main ways for you to do that. The first is Canvas, which is a visual way to stay organized. If you‚Äôre someone who likes to visually map things out before you get to work, Canvas lets you do that. You can generate full outlines, move cards around, even visualize and track your character relationships here.

The other way to stay organized is called Story Bible, and it‚Äôs one of Sudowrite‚Äôs more advanced features. Story Bible is a place for structured notes‚Äî it‚Äôs where you can put all of the details you know for sure about your story. So you'll see Braindump, Genre, Style, Synopsis, Characters, and Outline. The idea is everything you know for sure can go here, but anything you don't know or want a little help with can be generated with some help from AI.

So once you've added a Braindump and a Genre and a Style, you could generate a Synopsis. If the generation doesn't map to your vision, you can manually change that before proceeding to the next step. You have the option to generate something like a characters list (which would pull in any characters you‚Äôve already mentioned, while generating some new ones)... but you can also bring your own character list entirely

The goal is to fill out your entire Story Bible and gather those essential storytelling components in one place. If you complete your Story Bible, you even have the option to generate chapter-by-chapter prose‚Ä¶ you would do that using the Chapter Generator in a document. The best part is, with a full Story Bible, tools like Write get smarter‚Äîthey‚Äôll refer to your genre, tone, and character list to make sure they‚Äôre sticking to the project parameters you‚Äôve defined.

Story Bible is powerful, and quick to learn, but more difficult to master. For a deep dive on it, I‚Äôd recommend attending one of our live classes, or even joining our super active Sudowrite community Discord server where we share class recordings.

That‚Äôs it for our introduction, but let us know what questions you might have in the comments here. See you in the Discord, and Happy Writing.
