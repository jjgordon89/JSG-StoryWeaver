Organizing Your Projects

Last updated on November 20, 2024

Everyone has their own system when it comes to organizing their work, and now you can bring yours to Sudowrite. Project Folders can be used to track your project status, group your work by series or pen name, or just keep your desktop tidy.


You can create folders from the + New button in the upper lefthand corner, just like you would a new project. Drag and drop projects directly onto a folder to move them, or use the Move to option available in the three dot (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢) menu. A few things to know about folders:

Hover over any folder to preview your 3 most recent projects in that folder
Click on a preview to go directly into that project without opening the folder!
You can create or move folders inside of folders
Navigate easily with the file path provided at the top of your screen in folders
Projects can be dragged over that file path to relocate them
When you delete a folder, all its contents move to trash together. Don't worry‚Äîyou can restore entire folders (and their contents) from the Deleted projects page, available via the Settings menu (‚öôÔ∏è) in the upper right, if you need them back.

Folders transcript
While the visuals in the video above help illustrate the workflows outlined here, a transcript of the Folders video above is available by expanding this toggle.
Project folders are a new way to keep yourself focused and organized on Sudowrite. Here's how they work: First, click "New" in the upper left and select "Folder" to create a new folder. You can name that folder by selecting the name and typing - just hit return when you're done. Then you can move projects into that folder by just clicking and dragging. You'll be presented with a little preview of the projects that that folder contains. You can hover over the preview to flip through the projects, and you can even click straight into one of those projects from here without even opening the folder.


If there's a project that's a little bit far for clicking and dragging, you can use the three dots in the upper right and select "Move to" from the drop-down menu that appears. That will allow you to move it into any available folder. Folders can also contain other folders for even greater organization - just click "New" again inside of a folder to create a folder right there.
Here I can drag something one layer deeper, and then inside of that folder, I have a file path appear up top so I know exactly where I am. If I want to move something back out to another folder, I could use "Move to," or I can actually just drag on top of that file path and it will move where I drop it.


If I'm done with a folder, I can delete it from the three-dot menu. In tidying up the homepage, we've also moved deleted projects, so those now live here in the settings gear. You can click into "Deleted Projects" to see both projects and folders that you've deleted, and you can also restore them from the three-dot menu.


That's it! We hope these changes help you create a more organized workspace that lets you get more done.
