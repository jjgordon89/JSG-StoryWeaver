Worldbuilding
The Worldbuilding section of Story Bible is the place to create and store all of the important details of your world‚Äîeverything from settings, to items, to lore, and beyond. These building blocks help you stay organized, while giving the AI helpful context on your story world. Sudowrite uses the relevant context from your Worldbuilding cards when writing for you.

N.B. Completing the Worldbuilding section is optional, and you don‚Äôt need to add any Worldbuilding cards in order to use the Draft tool. That said, you‚Äôll get better results from the AI if you give it the additional context of frequently-referenced elements‚Äîfor example, describing a core setting.

When generating Worldbuilding elements, the Worldbuilding section is influenced by the Synopsis. Meanwhile, Worldbuilding directly informs your story‚Äôs Outline, Scenes, and Prose Generation (in Draft).
 
The Worldbuilding section is very open-ended. It provides a wide range of templates. No matter what you select, your Worldbuilding entry will be tracked on a collapsible, customizable card.

Worldbuilding Cards
Each individual Worldbuilding entry gets a card of its own in the Worldbuilding section of your Story Bible.

Cards are how you keep track of each entry, meaning that a card may represent a clue, magic system, setting, or something else altogether. You can select from the card templates available, or create an entirely custom entry using + Custom.

As with Characters, Worldbuilding entry cards can be collapsed using the arrow next to the element name, and dragged to your preferred order with the six-dot handle in the upper left.

The dropdown in the upper right of the card allows you to toggle the Worldbuilding entry type from the available options. You can see previous versions of that card in the card history‚Äîaccessed from the clock icon up top‚Äîand you can delete a Worldbuilding card using the three dots on the right.

Creating Worldbuilding Entries
You can create Worldbuilding entries with or without the AI‚Äôs help. If you click the purple Generate Entry button, you‚Äôll be able to select a type of entry and provide a prompt for what you‚Äôre trying to create. This is a great option if you already have notes available, and you want the AI to structure and flesh out those notes.

If you‚Äôd prefer to manually complete the card, just select from the available templates. Doing so creates a blank entry with all of the default traits for that entry type. 

Worldbuilding Traits & Trait Customization
Each type of Worldbuilding element has a slightly different set of default traits for you (or the AI) to complete. For example, the Clue template includes a Implications trait, whereas the Item template includes a Who owns this item trait. These traits offer a helpful starting point, but you can add to or change them as desired.

Individual traits can be added at the card level‚Äîsay for example if you have a specific setting that needs to include HOA details‚Äîby clicking + Add Trait at the bottom of that card. Title the trait, and fill it it as desired.

If you‚Äôd prefer to add something that should exist across all Setting cards you create, you‚Äôll want to update the Default Traits for all Setting elements by clicking Customize on the Worldbuilding section header. The process is the same for all the element templates‚Äîjust select a different element from the drop down.

As with Characters, traits are there both for your reference, and that of the AI. Traits inform how the AI will write about an entry when it is referenced (either directly, or using one of the defined ‚ÄúOther Names‚Äù). This is good to keep in mind when you‚Äôre titling and populating traits. A general rule is that if a junior writer or copy editor could make sense of your traits, the AI should be able to handle it well.

Generating Traits
After adding new default traits to pre-existing Character cards or Worldbuilding elements, you may wind up with a bunch of empty trait fields. Traits can always be filled in manually, but sometimes you want the AI‚Äôs help with that, so you have the ability to generate traits individually as well.

When a trait field is empty, just click Fill This In. You‚Äôll have the option to provide custom instructions, but you can also just click Go. The AI will then populate that trait field with something contextually appropriate.
The AI takes the rest of your Characters, Worldbuilding elements, and Story Bible context into consideration when generating those traits individually.
You also have the option to Rewrite trait fields that you‚Äôre not satisfied with. Just click Rewrite from within the trait field, provide custom instructions (if desired), and click Go. The AI looks at the current version of the trait, then rewrites it either according to provide instructions or (if blank) its own intuition and context.
