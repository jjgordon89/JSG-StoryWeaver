Here’s a quick look at some of the main AI features available within Sudowrite’s editor.

Write
Auto is for when you don’t know what should come next and you just want to see what the AI comes up with.
Guided is for when you have an idea of what should happen but want Sudowrite to draft it for you.
Describe adds rich sensory details—sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste—to any moment or object.
Rewrite improves phrasing, flow, or tone in an existing passage.
Brainstorm helps generate lists of ideas: names, powers, plot twists, worldbuilding elements, and more.
First Draft generates an extended scene (typically 500–1,000+ words) based on an outline or set of notes.
Expand adds length to your draft—whether that means slowing pacing or fleshing out a moment. (Tip: Use Describe if what you need is added detail.)
Plugins are customizable tools that extend Sudowrite’s core functionality. Use them to tweak tone, change POV, enhance dialogue, and more.
Scenes (found in the Story Engine) are the new, structured way to outline and generate your chapters. Each scene focuses on a specific time, place, or POV, and supports Extra Instructions to guide tone, pacing, and style. Scenes fully replace the older Beats system.
