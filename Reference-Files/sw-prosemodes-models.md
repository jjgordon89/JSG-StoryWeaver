Sudowrite allows you to select from a wide range of Prose Modes and AI models. Choosing different models effectively changes the AI performing the work, impacting output style, creativity, precision, and credit usage.

What are Prose Modes?
Prose Modes are carefully curated model suites designed specifically for fiction writing, each featuring a primary AI model enhanced by supportive configurations for optimal performance. You can use Sudowrite without ever toggling your Prose Mode, but experimenting with different modes allows you to discover variations in output. Prose Modes can be selected in both your Write settings and the Draft tool. (Other features currently do not support switching Prose Modes.)

Selecting a different Prose Mode directly impacts the AI models used, influencing credit usage and the style and content of generated text.

Current Prose Modes include:

Muse - Sudowrite's flagship fiction model, purpose-built for creative storytelling
Excellent - Powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, balancing creativity with precise instruction-following
Basic - Utilizing GPT-4o Mini, offering economical and efficient drafting
Retired, but still usable Prose Modes:

Most Accurate - Based on GPT-4
Balanced - Based on GPT-4 Turbo
Unfiltered - Based on Goliath 120B
Best Prose (v2) - Based on Claude 3 Opus
Best Prose (v1) - Based on Claude 2.0
Fastest - Based on GPT-3.5 Turbo
What are Experimental models?
In addition to Prose Modes, Sudowrite offers a variety of specific AI models accessible via Write settings and the Draft tool. These Experimental models have not been extensively optimized for specific writing styles or tasks but offer granular control for specialized scenarios.

Experimental models currently include:

GPT-4.1 (Full, Mini, Nano)
GPT-4o (Full, Mini)
Claude 3 Opus
Claude 3 Sonnet
Claude 3 Haiku
Claude 3.5 Sonnet
DeepSeek V3
DeepSeek R1
Goliath 120B
Mythomax 13B
Mistral Medium
Mixtral 7B Instruct
Mistral 7B Open Orca
Mistral OpenHermes 7B
Gemini Pro
Each AI model offers unique strengths, voices, and capabilities. We encourage authors to experiment broadly to identify the AI that best aligns with their individual writing needs and creative goals.

 
So are the Experimental models “raw” models?
Sort of. Keep in mind that Sudowrite has background prompting powering its features, and background functions (such as Saliency Engine) may influence what is ultimately seen by those models. Think of it like this:

Prose Modes = Optimized, Experimental Models = Raw*, Plugins = Raw

The only ways to use a truly “raw” AI model on Sudowrite is to build an Advanced Plugin using that model. Elsewhere we are doing some (or a lot!) of work to make sure things work great.
