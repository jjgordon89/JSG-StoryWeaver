Generating Chapter Prose
When using Story Bible sequentially‚Äîthat is, gradually developing your story from the ground up by completing those fields‚Äîthe final step of the process will be generating chapter prose using the Draft tool. Draft is represented by the little typewriter icon in top right corner of your text editor in Sudowrite.

Draft looks at your Style, Genre, Characters, Worldbuilding, and Scenes to write a first draft of that chapter for you. But before you can get help from Sudowrite generating that chapter‚Äôs prose, you first need to either write or generate those Scenes.

What are Scenes?
Scenes are the building blocks of chapters in Sudowrite‚Äôs Draft tool. They represent distinct moments in your story‚Äîeach one typically encompassing a single location, timeframe, or character context. A chapter may have one scene, or several.

Scenes let you guide Sudowrite to write your chapter exactly the way you imagine it. Whether you're describing a heated conversation in a cabin, a chase through city streets, or a quiet reflection on a rooftop, each Scene is a self-contained unit of storytelling. This format should feel familiar and intuitive for anyone who has ever read a book or watched a movie‚Äîa scene is something happening to someone (or someones) somewhere‚Äîand it allows Sudowrite to generate focused prose that closely follows your structure and creative vision.

Think of Scenes as the natural atomic units of storytelling‚Äîaligned with how writers already plan and think about narrative flow.

How do I generate chapter prose from Scenes?
Scenes are the precursor step to prose generation in Sudowrite. Here‚Äôs how they work step-by-step:

1. Break your chapter down into Scenes

The top box of the Draft tool is labeled Scenes. This is where you list the key narrative moments you want your chapter to contain. Each Scene appears as a numbered item in a list, and may be as short or as long as you like. You can:

Write your own Scenes manually.
Or click Generate Scenes to have Sudowrite generate a list based on your linked Outline‚Äôs chapter summary.
Scenes take advantage of a feature called Story Bible Detection, which lets you know when something or someone mentioned in a Scene is recognized from your Story Bible. Detected Characters and Worldbuilding elements will appear underlined, whether you generated those Scenes or wrote them yourself.

2. Optionally add Extra Instructions

The Draft box includes an Extra Instructions field below your Scenes. This is where you can optionally include specific notes that Sudowrite should consider when writing chapter, including:

Point of view (POV)
Tense (e.g., past or present)
Style or tone reinforcement (e.g., ‚Äúdreamlike,‚Äù ‚Äúsparse and fast-paced‚Äù)
Specific plot notes (e.g., ‚ÄúMake sure the antagonist appears at the end‚Äù)
These instructions can reiterate other parts of your Story Bible, and help Sudowrite better match your unique storytelling voice and intent.

üí°
Sudowrite will generate chapter prose using the default model, Muse, unless you say otherwise. Click the dropdown arrow to the right of the Generate button to toggle between Prose Modes and AI models as desired. Make sure to do so before you click Generate!

3. Incorporate helpful feedback

With those fields complete, you can click Generate to have Sudowrite automatically analyze your Scenes to make sure they‚Äôre clear and well-structured. If a Scene looks too short, too sprawling‚Äîsuch as covering too many events, characters, or locations‚Äîor something else, you‚Äôll see a friendly suggestion with a proposed fix. You can:

Accept the Quick Fix (like splitting a Scene or clarifying it)
Or ignore the suggestion altogether and proceed with your current Scenes as-is
This first stage ‚Äúcheck‚Äù also creates a word count and credit estimate, so you can know what to expect when you do proceed.

4. Generate your chapter

Once you‚Äôre happy with your Scenes and the estimates provided, just click Generate. Sudowrite will:

Write your chapter in prose, closely following your structure and tone
Each Scene is transformed into part of a seamless, compelling chapter draft that should closely match your vision for the story. You can watch the prose magically appear in the document below‚Äîand you can always pause the generation if you notice the AI is taking one too many creative liberties.
