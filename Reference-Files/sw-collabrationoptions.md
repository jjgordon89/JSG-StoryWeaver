Whether you're working with a collaborator, an editor, or you just want to share your work, Sudowrite offers powerful collaboration features to help you get feedback on your writing. You can effortlessly create and share links to your work and even collect comments from readers, all while maintaining control over the sharing process.

Document Sharing
Share your writing directly from Sudowrite with beta readers and collaborators. Whether it's a single chapter or a complete manuscript, you can generate shareable links that present your work beautifully.

To share a document:

Click the Share icon in the upper right corner of your screen (next to the ‚öôÔ∏è settings gear).
Click the Share button to generate a link for your current document
Alternatively, use the dropdown arrow beside the Share button to share a different document from your project
The link will be automatically copied to your clipboard, and you can always click the Copy button to grab that URL again. Anyone with that link can view your document. Meanwhile, you can click on the project in that Share menu to open the version of your document published to the web.

A few things to know about document sharing:

You can track all of your project‚Äôs shared documents in the Share menu
Unpublish shared documents anytime from that Share menu using the three dot (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢) menu
Changes you make to your document in the editor are automatically reflected in the shared version (though readers may need to refresh)
You can share multiple versions of your story by duplicating your document and generating different share links
Clean Copy and Comments
Clean Copy is a feature of Sudowrite‚Äôs document sharing functionality that transforms how you collect and manage reader feedback. Share your document, distribute the URL, and each reader gets their own clean copy to comment on if they wish‚Äîkeeping feedback both organized and private.

Here's how Clean Copy works:

Each reader can comment on the document you‚Äôve shared with them by highlighting a passage and leaving their comment in the box that appears.
If they‚Äôre logged into Sudowrite, their display name will appear automatically. If they‚Äôre not, they can either log in, set a display name (only necessary once on the first comment they leave), or remain anonymous.
Readers never see one another‚Äôs comments‚Äîkeeping your feedback unbiased. They will however see any responses that you, as the author, make to their comment.
Comments will appear along your document's right side. And of course, you can also now comment on your own document from the selection menu, which is super handy for revision workflows and situations where you'd just like to leave yourself notes. If you want to hide comments, just click the  comment icon in the document toolbar to toggle them on/off.
With Comment Mode enabled, you will see all comments you‚Äôve received along the right side of your document.
As the author, you can also leave yourself comments! No need to do so on a shared document either‚Äîyou‚Äôll see a New Comment option in the selection menu when you highlight a passage in your editor.

Important note: If you shared documents before Clean Copy was released, you'll need to unpublish and republish those documents to enable commenting.

Best Practices for Collaboration
Unpublish old shared versions when you want to direct readers to newer drafts
Use your own comments to track revision ideas while reviewing reader feedback
Share different drafts with different groups of readers by creating multiple share links
Check that readers are viewing the latest version by having them refresh occasionally
Clean Copy and document sharing make it easy to maintain a smooth feedback process with your readers while keeping your work organized within Sudowrite.
