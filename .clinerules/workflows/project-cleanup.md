# Documentation Project Cleanup Workflow

This workflow helps you clean up and organize your documentation project, removing stale content and ensuring everything is current and well-organized.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of your documentation project structure
- Access to project analytics or usage data (if available)
- Backup or version control of current state
- Time allocated for thorough review (45-90 minutes for documentation projects)

## Steps

### 1. Run Global Cleanup First

- Execute the global project cleanup workflow: `/project-cleanup.md`
- Complete general file organization and cleanup tasks
- Return here for documentation-specific cleanup

### 2. Content Audit and Organization

**Review Documentation Structure:**

- Check that all content follows your project's organization standards
- Verify navigation and cross-references work correctly
- Ensure content hierarchy makes sense for users
- Look for orphaned pages or broken internal links

**Assess Content Currency:**

- Identify documentation that references outdated versions
- Find content that hasn't been updated in 6+ months
- Check for deprecated features or tools still being documented
- Verify all external links still work and point to current resources

### 3. Documentation-Specific Cleanup

**Remove Outdated Content:**

- Archive or remove documentation for deprecated features
- Update version-specific information to current versions
- Remove or update screenshots that show outdated interfaces
- Clean up old examples that no longer work

**Consolidate Duplicate Content:**

- Look for information covered in multiple places
- Merge similar topics into comprehensive guides
- Remove redundant explanations or examples
- Create cross-references instead of duplicating content

**Update Navigation and Structure:**

- Verify table of contents reflects current content
- Update navigation menus and sidebars
- Fix broken internal links and references
- Ensure consistent heading structure throughout

### 4. Asset and Media Cleanup

**Review Images and Media:**

- Remove unused images, screenshots, or diagrams
- Update outdated screenshots to current versions
- Optimize image file sizes for web performance
- Ensure all images have appropriate alt text

**Clean Up Code Examples:**

- Test all code examples to ensure they still work
- Update examples to use current syntax and best practices
- Remove examples for deprecated APIs or methods
- Ensure code formatting is consistent

### 5. Verify Research and Sources

**Check Source Validity:**

- Verify all external links are still active and relevant
- Update citations to point to current versions
- Remove references to discontinued tools or services
- Ensure all claims are still accurate and current

**Update Research Notes:**

- Review verification notes and update dates
- Re-verify critical technical information
- Update maintenance schedules for important content
- Document any changes in authoritative sources

### 6. Quality Assurance Review

**Content Quality Check:**

- Ensure all content meets current project standards
- Verify writing style is consistent throughout
- Check that technical accuracy is maintained
- Ensure accessibility guidelines are followed

**User Experience Review:**

- Test navigation from a new user perspective
- Verify search functionality works correctly
- Check that content is logically organized
- Ensure mobile-friendly formatting

### 7. Documentation Maintenance Updates

**Update Maintenance Information:**

- Refresh "last updated" dates on revised content
- Update maintenance schedules for regular reviews
- Document any structural changes made during cleanup
- Create or update changelog entries

**Review and Update Templates:**

- Ensure documentation templates are current
- Update style guides and writing standards
- Refresh example content in templates
- Verify template instructions are clear and current

- **Solution**: Systematic review and testing of all technical content
- **Prevention**: Regular maintenance schedule and user feedback monitoring

### Broken Navigation

- **Symptoms**: 404 errors, missing pages in navigation, circular references
- **Solution**: Comprehensive link checking and navigation testing
- **Prevention**: Automated link checking and regular navigation audits

### Inconsistent Formatting

- **Symptoms**: Mixed heading styles, inconsistent code formatting, varied image sizes
- **Solution**: Style guide enforcement and systematic formatting review
- **Prevention**: Clear style guidelines and template usage

### Duplicate or Conflicting Information

- **Symptoms**: Same topic covered differently in multiple places, contradictory instructions
- **Solution**: Content audit and consolidation of related topics
- **Prevention**: Content planning and regular review of related topics

## Automation Opportunities

### Automated Checks

- Link checking tools for external references
- Spell check and grammar validation
- Image optimization and alt-text verification
- Code example syntax validation

### Regular Maintenance Scripts

- Generate reports of pages not updated in X months
- Check for broken internal links
- Validate code examples against current APIs
- Monitor external link health

### Content Analytics

- Track which pages are most/least visited
- Identify content that generates support questions
- Monitor user feedback and comments
- Track search queries that return no results

## Best Practices for Documentation Cleanup

### Prevention Strategies

- Establish regular review cycles (monthly/quarterly)
- Use templates to maintain consistency
- Implement peer review for all content changes
- Set up automated monitoring for common issues

### Execution Tips

- Focus on high-traffic content first
- Test all changes in staging environment
- Keep detailed notes of changes made
- Involve subject matter experts in technical reviews

### Maintenance Planning

- Schedule regular cleanup sessions
- Assign ownership for different content areas
- Create alerts for content that needs review
- Plan for major updates and migrations

## Integration with Project Standards

This cleanup workflow should align with your project's:

- **Content standards** (see tech stack rules)
- **Quality requirements** (see current requirements)
- **User experience goals** (see project overview)
- **Research methodology** (see research workflow)

## Success Indicators

After completing this cleanup:

- All content is current and accurate
- Navigation is intuitive and complete
- User feedback indicates improved experience
- Maintenance burden is reduced
- Content meets all project quality standards

Remember: Documentation cleanup is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Regular maintenance prevents major cleanup sessions and keeps your documentation valuable and trustworthy.
