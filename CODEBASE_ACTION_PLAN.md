# CODEBASE ACTION PLAN — StoryWeaver

Generated: 2025-08-12

This action plan documents discovered technical debt, incomplete implementations, and potential issues across the codebase. Each item includes a priority, effort estimate, dependencies, checkboxes for tracking, file references, and a suggested implementation approach.

Legend:

- Priority: [Critical] [High] [Medium] [Low]
- Effort: h = hours, d = days
- [ ] = not started, [~] = in progress, [x] = done

Note on line numbers: Where exact line numbers are not reliable due to tooling constraints, a search token is provided to quickly navigate (Ctrl/Cmd+F). The file references are precise and the snippets are uniquely identifiable.

---

## 0) Executive Summary

- Critical security and reliability work has been COMPLETED: backend error-handling standardization (unwrap/expect usage) and input validation coverage across Tauri commands with size, length, sanitization, and numeric-bounds checks.
- **NEW:** E2E test infrastructure is now STABLE: Fixed all selector mismatches in Playwright tests; all tests pass across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.
- **NEW:** Rust test suite compilation STABILIZED: All compilation errors in the StoryWeaver Rust test suite have been resolved. `cargo check --tests` now exits with code 0, indicating successful compilation with only warnings remaining.
- High-priority product work includes implementing AI streaming write path, cost estimation, and completing the Advanced AI overlay actions (cancel/copy/save/time tracking).
- Backend filter logic for AI card operations is stubbed and should be completed (date range, provider/model, cost).
- Context building includes Story Bible integration; Brainstorm flow now uses base_prompt with AI provider and persists brainstorm cards.
- Testing coverage: E2E foundation is solid; frontend unit tests and backend integration tests still needed.

---

## 1) Incomplete Implementations

1.1 Implement streaming write functionality in AIWritingPanel

- Priority: High
- Effort: 8–12h
- Dependencies: useAIWriteStream, backend streaming commands (guided_write_stream, write stream route), token/cost accounting
- Files:
  - src/components/ai/AIWritingPanel.tsx (search: "TODO: Implement streaming write functionality")
- [x] Implement streaming branch in "write" case (when settings.write.prose_mode === 'streaming') — wired to useAIWriteStream.startStreamingWrite in AIWritingPanel
- [x] Wire to useAIWriteStream hook to start/pause/stop subscriptions — start wired; pause/resume/stop UI controls now connected to useAIStreaming
- [x] Forward streaming segments into StreamingText component and cards — StreamingText consumes store updates; onComplete persists card
- Suggested approach:
  - Create a startWriteStream(documentId, cursorPosition, settings) that requests a stream_id from backend
  - Subscribe to Tauri event channel for stream chunks
  - On complete, call handleStreamingComplete to persist card entry

1.2 Implement credit/cost estimation in AIWritingPanel

- Priority: High
- Effort: 3–5h
- Dependencies: Token estimator, pricing table, WriteResult tokens_used
- Files:
  - src/components/ai/AIWritingPanel.tsx (search: "TODO: Implement credit estimation")
- [x] Replace const estimatedCost = 0 with real estimator — added aiCost.ts and integrated estimator in AIWritingPanel
- [x] Display cost badge before execution; include tool, model, and input size as factors — badge shown; tool/input factored; model factor integrated
- Suggested approach:
  - Create shared estimator utility using model-specific prices (per-1k tokens in/out)
  - Use selection length or prompt length for estimate, show range for streaming

1.3 AdvancedAI Overlay: cancel/copy/save/time tracking

- Priority: High
- Effort: 1–2d
- Dependencies: advancedAIStore capabilities, projectStore insert action, persistence layer
- Files:
  - src/components/AdvancedAI/StreamingStatusOverlay.tsx

- [x] Add cancelGeneration action into advancedAIStore to abort backend stream and mark status
- [x] Provide store-based utility for clipboard copy (with toast)
- [x] Plumb original prompt into generation metadata from calling site
- [x] Implement saveGeneratedContent to chosen location (document/snippet/note) — front-end action added; backend command implemented (save_generated_content)
- [x] Track generation start/end timestamps and compute elapsed time
- Suggested approach:
  - Augment advancedAIStore with fields: startedAt, finishedAt, streamId
  - Persist saves via a Tauri command that writes snippets/notes to DB

1.4 StyleManager actions (update/delete/bulk/generate-from-style)

- Priority: Medium
- Effort: 2–3d

- [x] Add unit tests to verify badge rendering and cost calculation accuracy
- Suggested approach:
  - Reuse estimator from AIWritingPanel to ensure consistent pricing
  - Add unit tests to verify badge rendering and disabled states when credits are insufficient

---

## 2) Code Quality Issues

2.1 Standardize error handling: replace unwrap/expect

- Priority: Critical
- Effort: 2–3d
- Dependencies: StoryWeaverError patterns, error.rs factory
- Files (examples; non-exhaustive):
  - src-tauri/src/database/operations/collaboration.rs (multiple unwrap/expect on id, conversions)
  - src-tauri/src/security/encryption.rs (unwrap on path parent)
  - src-tauri/src/lib.rs (expect on tauri application)
  - src-tauri/src/ai/brainstorm.rs (sessions.get(...).unwrap())
  - src-tauri/src/background/mod.rs:273 tasks.remove(index).unwrap()
  - src-tauri/src/database/operations/collaboration.rs:49, 287, 414, 566, 661 unwrap/unwrap_or chains
- [x] Replace unwrap/expect with ? and map_err to StoryWeaverError in collaboration.rs
- [x] Replace unwrap_or patterns with and_then and filter_map in brainstorm_session_ops.rs
- [x] Add proper error logging with tracing::warn for invalid data parsing
- [x] Verify encryption.rs, token_counter.rs, prose_mode_ops.rs use safe patterns
- [x] Standardize error envelope returned to UI
- Suggested approach:
  - Introduce helpers like to_db_error, to_io_error
  - Ensure no sensitive info leaks in messages

2.2 Duplicate/Conflicting UI labels in AIWritingPanel

- Priority: Medium
- Effort: 1–2h
- Dependencies: None
- Files:
  - src/components/ai/AIWritingPanel.tsx (two "Tone" selectors)
- [x] Consolidate tone controls, ensure distinct labels (e.g., “Tone Category” vs “Prose Mode”)
- [x] Validate settings.write shape alignment with store

2.3 Consistency: mock modes and dev stubs

- Priority: Medium
- Effort: 6–10h
- Dependencies: Build-time env gating
- Files:
  - src/utils/tauriSafe.ts (mock mode returns mock stream_id and text)
  - src/stores/versionStore.ts (mock in API simulation)
- [x] Gate all mock paths behind NODE_ENV === 'development' or explicit setting — tauriSafe gated; versionStore completed
- [x] Ensure production build cannot fall back to mock responses
- Suggested approach:
  - Introduce feature flags and a single MockGuard utility

2.4 Framework mixing (React + Svelte)

- Priority: Medium
- Effort: 2–3d (analysis/design); impl incremental
- Dependencies: Decision on mid/long-term direction
- Files:
  - src/components/SeriesConsistencyReport.svelte
  - src/components/SeriesConsistencyWidget.svelte
  - src/lib/components/templates/*.svelte
- [x] Decide consolidation target (React-only or hybrid boundary)
- [x] Create interop boundaries or plan migration of Svelte components to React (or vice versa)
- Suggested approach:
  - Document interop costs and target architecture
  - Prioritize porting components with most usage first

**Progress Update - 2025-08-12:**

- ✅ Created comprehensive Framework-Mixing-Analysis.md documenting the consolidation strategy
- ✅ Decided on React-only consolidation approach based on ecosystem alignment
- ✅ Successfully migrated SeriesConsistencyReport.svelte → SeriesConsistencyReport.tsx
- ✅ Successfully migrated SeriesConsistencyWidget.svelte → SeriesConsistencyWidget.tsx

- [x] Ensure validate_safe_name, path checks, request size guards on all entry points
- [ ] Unit tests for each command path (valid/invalid inputs)
- Suggested approach:
  - Introduce per-command validator modules
  - Add size-limits middleware-like helpers

3.2 Rate limiting completeness

- Priority: High
- Effort: 1–2d
- Dependencies: src-tauri/src/security/rate_limit.rs (foundation exists, tests exist)

- [ ] Map keys: per-project/per-document/per-feature
- [ ] Include sensible defaults and per-feature overrides
- Suggested approach:
  - Central throttle registry queried by commands before heavy ops

3.3 Card storage coupling and persistence

- Priority: Medium
- Effort: 1–2d
- Dependencies: addCard usage
- Files:
  - src/components/ai/AIWritingPanel.tsx (adds card after results)
- [ ] Ensure addCard persists to DB via Tauri, not only in-memory
- Suggested approach:
  - Confirm underlying useCards hook uses Tauri invoke persistently with retries and error handling

3.4 Performance: cache sweeper and indices

- Priority: Medium

- [ ] Add cargo audit / npm audit
- [ ] Add dependency review and code scanning
- [ ] Schedule weekly scans (per SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md)

---

## 5) Testing Gaps

5.1 Frontend unit tests expansion

- Priority: High
- Effort: 2–4d
- Dependencies: Vitest, Testing Library
- Files:
  - Existing: src/components/**tests**/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx
  - Existing: src/hooks/**tests**/useErrorHandler.test.ts
- [ ] Add tests for hooks: useAI, useAIWriteStream, useAICreative, useAISettings, useAICredits
- [ ] Add tests for AIWritingPanel basic flows (prompt entry, button disabled states, insert/replace callback)
- [ ] Add tests for StreamingStatusOverlay behaviors
- [ ] Add tests for AIQuickTools cost estimation badge and disable rules

5.2 Backend integration tests for commands

- Priority: High
- Effort: 3–5d
- Dependencies: Test harness with sqlite temp DB
- Files:
  - src-tauri/src/commands/*.rs
- [~] Spin up ephemeral DB, cover happy-path and validation failure path
  - Status: Test compilation FIXED (all compilation errors resolved); runtime execution blocked by Windows DLL issues
- [ ] Include rate-limit hit path behavior

5.3 E2E coverage with Playwright

- Priority: Medium
- Effort: 3–5d
- Dependencies: playwright.config.ts
- Files: tests/e2e/*
- [x] **COMPLETED 2025-01-14:** Fixed e2e test selector issues - Updated all test files to use correct UI selectors
- [ ] Core flows: create project -> open doc -> AI write -> card saved -> reopen app shows persisted card
- [ ] Negative flows: invalid names, too-large content blocked with message

**E2E Test Fixes Completed:**

- ✅ Fixed selector mismatch in all e2e test files (backup-recovery.spec.ts, document-linking.spec.ts, folder-hierarchy.spec.ts, project-preview.spec.ts, version-history.spec.ts)
- ✅ Updated `h1:has-text("StoryWeaver")` selectors to `h1:has-text("Projects")` to match actual UI
- ✅ All tests now pass successfully across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers
- ✅ Resolved timeout issues that were preventing proper e2e test execution

---

## 6) Deprecated/Outdated Patterns and Dependencies

6.1 Dependency audit follow-up

- Priority: Low
- Effort: 4–8h
- Dependencies: SECURITY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md notes
- Files:
  - Backend: reqwest 0.11 (consider 0.12), tokio "1.0" (pin to ^1.38 to adopt newer runtime improvements), bcrypt 0.17 (ok), rsa monitoring via sqlx-mysql transitive (monitor)
  - Frontend: React 18.2 (ok), Vite 7.1, Playwright 1.40 (can upgrade to latest)
- [ ] Evaluate bump feasibility; run smoke tests

6.2 Build guard for mocks

- Priority: Medium
- Effort: 2–4h
- Files:
  - src/utils/tauriSafe.ts
- [x] Ensure mock mode cannot ship in production builds — tauriSafe throws in production

---

## 7) Task Dependency Graph (High-level)

- Standardized error handling (2.1) underpins robust endpoint behavior; do before heavy new features.
- Input validation coverage (3.1/4.1) should be completed early to secure all code paths.
- AI streaming write (1.1) depends on stable streaming backend and store cancelation (1.3).
- Card filter backends (1.7) benefit from indices decisions (3.4).
- Testing tasks (5.*) should follow feature completions but at least smoke/unit tests should be added in parallel.

## 10) Suggested Implementation Patterns

- Error handling: Prefer `?` with `map_err(|e| StoryWeaverError::X { ... })` and central factory for shaping responses.
- Validation: Introduce per-command validator modules with typed input structs and unit tests.
- Streaming: Use Tauri event channels; ensure cancel path stops server-side task and unsubscribes listeners.
- Cost estimation: Centralize model pricing in one config; compute (input_tokens *in_price + output_tokens* out_price).
- Cache cleanup: TTL per entry + periodic cleanup via background task; expose manual trigger command.
- Testing:
  - Frontend: vitest + react-testing-library, mock Tauri invoke.
  - Backend: tokio::test with temp sqlite; property tests for validation (quickcheck style if desired).
  - E2E: Playwright happy-path + negative validation scenarios.

---

## 11) Milestones and Sequencing

## 12) Risk Notes

- Streaming cancellation requires careful backend task management to prevent orphan processes.
- Mixing frameworks increases maintenance overhead; decide a clear target to reduce long-term complexity.
- Replacing unwraps can uncover latent error cases; allocate time to handle edge scenarios properly.
- Filter queries may require new indices to maintain performance.

Prepared as a living document. Update checkboxes as items progress, and extend sections with line-precise refs when specific files are actively being worked on.

### Update Note — 2025-08-12

- Centralized validator helpers added at [src-tauri/src/security/validators.rs](src-tauri/src/security/validators.rs:1) and exported via [src-tauri/src/security/mod.rs](src-tauri/src/security/mod.rs:1)
- Integration tests extended in [src-tauri/src/tests/integration_commands_tests.rs](src-tauri/src/tests/integration_commands_tests.rs:1) to cover:
  - Invalid IDs (security patterns)
  - Oversized bodies (content/metadata size limits)
  - Empty strings (search query)
  - Negative numeric bounds (order_index, age)
  - Existing happy-path tests remain as baseline coverage

### Update Note — 2025-01-14: Rust Test Suite Compilation Fixes

**COMPLETED:** All compilation errors in the StoryWeaver Rust test suite have been resolved. `cargo check --tests` now exits with code 0.

**Key Fixes Applied:**

- **Missing Imports:** Added `use crate::ai::TokenCounter;` to `src-tauri/src/tests/error_handling_tests.rs`
- **Database Initialization:** Replaced deprecated `create_test_pool()` calls with `init_test_db().await.expect("Failed to init test db");` and `get_pool().expect("Failed to get pool");` pattern across test files
- **Method Signature Corrections:** Fixed `TokenCounter::estimate_cost()` calls to provide all 4 required arguments: provider, model, input_tokens, output_tokens
- **Function Name Updates:** Corrected `move_document_to_trash` to `trash_document` with proper argument structure
- **Code Structure:** Moved orphaned `let` statements from global scope into appropriate test functions
- **Result Handling:** Removed incorrect `.expect()` calls on `TokenCounter::new()` which returns `Self` directly, not a `Result`

**Files Modified:**

- `src-tauri/src/tests/error_handling_tests.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/tests/ai_card_filtering_tests.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/tests/integration_commands_tests.rs`

**Status:** Compilation successful with 157 warnings remaining (primarily unused imports and variables). Runtime test execution still has issues (STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND - likely Windows DLL issue), but compilation phase is now stable.

No changes to existing checklist statuses beyond validation coverage already marked complete; this note documents exact files updated for validation/test coverage.
